# WARP3

The repository contains resources for my (intended) presentation at the [WARP3](http://warp3.unical.it/wp/), the 3rd International Workshop on Arc Routing Problems â€“ Pizzo (Calabria, Italy) May 27-29, 2019.

Models developed for the presentation are available under [/models](https://github.com/ejwillemse/WARP3/models), data used under [/data](https://github.com/ejwillemse/WARP3/data), and resulting documents and presentations under [/docs](/docs).

## Presentation abstract

1. New CARP variants are being introduced.
2. Variants are introduced and studied in isolation that can be easily transformed to other variants, also studied in isolation. MCARP vs MGRP as an example: easy to transform between them, yet no comparison of techniques and benchmark problems.
3. New brief of Algorithms: first check if existing methods can be used.
4. [main path analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_path_analysis) or just [citation analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_analysis) is used to analyse existing CARP research.
5. Through the analysis, conceptually close (problem variant), yet loosly-connected (citation wise, benchmark problems, solution tecniques) pockets of research can be identified.
6. The analysis can be used to improve the transfer and extension of research to better deal with new variants.
