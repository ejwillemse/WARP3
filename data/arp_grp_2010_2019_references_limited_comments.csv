"LACOMME P, 2006, COMPUT OPER RES",A GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR A BI-OBJECTIVE CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM,"THE CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM (CARP) IS A VERY HARD VEHICLE ROUTING PROBLEM FOR WHICH THE OBJECTIVE-IN ITS CLASSICAL FORM-IS THE MINIMIZATION OF THE TOTAL COST OF THE ROUTES. IN ADDITION, ONE CAN SEEK TO MINIMIZE ALSO THE COST OF THE LONGEST TRIP. IN THIS PAPER, A MULTI-OBJECTIVE GENETIC ALGORITHM IS PRESENTED FOR THIS MORE REALISTIC CARP. INSPIRED BY THE SECOND VERSION OF THE NON-DOMINATED SORTED GENETIC ALGORITHM FRAMEWORK, THE PROCEDURE IS IMPROVED BY USING GOOD CONSTRUCTIVE HEURISTICS TO SEED THE INITIAL POPULATION AND BY INCLUDING A LOCAL SEARCH PROCEDURE. THE NEW FRAMEWORK AND ITS DIFFERENT FLAVOUR IS APPRAISED ON THREE SETS OF CLASSICAL CARP INSTANCES COMPRISING 81 FILES. YET DESIGNED FOR A BI-OBJECTIVE PROBLEM, THE BEST VERSIONS ARE COMPETITIVE WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART METAHEURISTICS FOR THE SINGLE OBJECTIVE CARP, BOTH IN TERMS OF SOLUTION QUALITY AND COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY: INDEED, THEY RETRIEVE A MAJORITY OF PROVEN OPTIMA AND IMPROVE TWO BEST-KNOWN SOLUTIONS.

"SHANG R, 2014, INF SCI",A MULTI-POPULATION COOPERATIVE COEVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM FOR MULTI-OBJECTIVE CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM,"CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM (CARP) HAS DRAWN MUCH ATTENTION DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS. IN ADDITION TO THE GOAL OF MINIMIZING THE TOTAL COST OF ALL THE ROUTES, MANY REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS OF CARP ALSO NEED TO BALANCE THESE ROUTES. THE MULTI-OBJECTIVE CARP (MO-CARP) COMMONLY EXISTS IN PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS. IN ORDER TO SOLVE MO-CARP EFFICIENTLY AND ACCURATELY, THIS PAPER PRESENTS A MULTI-POPULATION COOPERATIVE COEVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM (MPCCA) FOR MO-CARP. FIRSTLY, MPCCA APPLIES THE DIVIDE-AND-CONQUER METHOD TO DECOMPOSE THE WHOLE POPULATION INTO MULTIPLE SUBPOPULATIONS ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT DIRECTION VECTORS. THESE SUBPOPULATIONS EVOLVE SEPARATELY IN EACH GENERATION AND THE ADJACENT SUBPOPULATIONS CAN SHARE THEIR INDIVIDUALS IN THE FORM OF COOPERATIVE SUBPOPULATIONS. SECONDLY, MULTIPLE SUBPOPULATIONS ARE USED TO SEARCH DIFFERENT OBJECTIVE SUBREGIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY, SO INDIVIDUALS IN EACH SUBPOPULATION HAVE A DIFFERENT FITNESS FUNCTION, WHICH CAN BE MODELED AS A SINGLE OBJECTIVE CARP (SO-CARP). THE ADVANCED MAENS APPROACH FOR SINGLE-OBJECTIVE CARP CAN BE USED TO SEARCH EACH OBJECTIVE SUBREGION. THIRDLY, THE INTERNAL ELITISM ARCHIVE IS USED TO CONSTRUCT EVOLUTIONARY POOL FOR EACH SUBREGION, WHICH GREATLY SPEEDS UP THE CONVERGENCE. LASTLY, THE FAST NONDOMINATED RANKING AND CROWDING DISTANCE OF NSGA-II ARE USED FOR SELECTING THE OFFSPRING AND KEEPING THE DIVERSITY. MPCCA IS TESTED ON 91 CARP BENCHMARKS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT MPCCA OBTAINS BETTER GENERALIZATION PERFORMANCE OVER THE COMPARED ALGORITHMS. (C) 2014 ELSEVIER INC.

"GRANDINETTI L, 2010, EXPERIMENTAL ALGORITHMS, PROCEEDINGS",AN APPROXIMATE EPSILON-CONSTRAINT METHOD FOR THE MULTI-OBJECTIVE UNDIRECTED CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM,"THE UNDIRECTED CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM IS A CLASSICAL ARC ROUTING PROBLEM ARISING IN PRACTICAL SITUATIONS (ROAD MAINTENANCE, GARBAGE COLLECTION, MAIL DELIVERY, SCHOOL BUS ROUTING, ETC.) WITH THE AIM OF MINIMIZING THE TOTAL TRANSPORTATION COST OF A SET OF ROUTES THAT SERVICE A SET OF REQUIRED EDGES UNDER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS. MOST OF LOGISTIC COMPANIES ARE INTERESTED IN MINIMIZING NOT ONLY THE TOTAL TRANSPORTATION COST, THEY ALSO ARE FOCUSED IN MANAGING THE DELIVERIES ON THE EDGES, IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE DURATION OF THE LONGEST TRIP DOES NOT EXCEED AN UPPER TIME LIMIT, TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE WORKING DAY DURATION OF THE DRIVERS. MOREOVER, ALL THE DEMANDS OF THE REQUIRED EDGES ARE SATISFIED BY CONSIDERING A LIMITED NUMBER OF VEHICLES AT THE DEPOT. IN THIS PAPER, THE MULTI-OBJECTIVE UNDIRECTED CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM WHERE DIFFERENT AND COMPETITIVE OBJECTIVES ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT SIMULTANEOUSLY, IS DEFINED AND STUDIED. THREE OBJECTIVES ARE CONSIDERED IN ORDER TO: MINIMIZE THE TOTAL TRANSPORTATION COST, THE LONGEST ROUTE (MAKESPAN) AND THE NUMBER OF VEHICLE USED TO SERVICE ALL THE REQUIRED EDGES (I.E., THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ROUTES). TO FIND A SET OF SOLUTIONS BELONGING TO THE OPTIMAL PARETO FRONT, AN OPTIMIZATION-BASED HEURISTIC PROCEDURE IS PROPOSED AND ITS PERFORMANCE IS EVALUATED ON A SET OF BENCHMARK INSTANCES.",1,0,1,0,Bi-objective Capacitated Arc Routing Problem under Time Restrictions,Bi-objective Capacitated Arc Routing Problem,,Minimise fleet size,
"ALBIACH J, 2008, EUR J OPER RES",AN ASYMMETRIC TSP WITH TIME WINDOWS AND WITH TIME-DEPENDENT TRAVEL TIMES AND COSTS: AN EXACT SOLUTION THROUGH A GRAPH TRANSFORMATION,"IN THIS PAPER WE DEAL WITH AN EXTENDED VERSION OF THE ASYMMETRIC TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM WITH TIME WINDOWS (ATSPTW) THAT CONSIDERS TIME-DEPENDENT TRAVEL TIMES AND COSTS, FOR A MORE ACCURATE APPROXIMATION OF SOME ROUTING PROBLEMS INSIDE LARGE CITIES, IN WHICH THE TIME OR COST OF TRAVERSING CERTAIN STREETS (E.G. MAIN AVENUES) DEPENDS ON THE MOMENT OF THE DAY (FOR EXAMPLE RUSH-HOURS). UNLIKE OTHER EXISTING PAPERS ABOUT TIME-DEPENDENT ROUTING PROBLEMS, WE FOCUS ON AN EXACT METHOD FOR SOLVING THIS NEW PROBLEM. FOR THIS END WE FIRST TRANSFORM THE PROBLEM INTO AN ASYMMETRIC GENERALIZED TSP AND THEN INTO A GRAPHICAL ASYMMETRIC TSP. IN THIS WAY, WE CAN APPLY A KNOWN EXACT ALGORITHM FOR THE MIXED GENERAL ROUTING PROBLEM, WHICH SEEMS TO RUN WELL WITH OUR RESULTING INSTANCES. COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS ARE PRESENTED ON A SET OF 270 ADAPTED INSTANCES FROM BENCHMARK ATSPTW INSTANCES. (C) 2006 ELSEVIER B.V.

"SHANG R, 2014, APPL SOFT COMPUT",AN IMPROVED DECOMPOSITION-BASED MEMETIC ALGORITHM FOR MULTI-OBJECTIVE CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM,"CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM (CARP) HAS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF MANY RESEARCHERS DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS, BECAUSE IT HAS A WIDE APPLICATION IN THE REAL WORLD. RECENTLY, A DECOMPOSITION-BASED MEMETIC ALGORITHM FOR MULTI-OBJECTIVE CARP (D-MAENS) HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE A COMPETITIVE APPROACH. HOWEVER, THE REPLACEMENT MECHANISM AND THE ASSIGNMENT MECHANISM OF THE OFFSPRING IN D-MAENS REMAIN TO BE IMPROVED. FIRST, THE REPLACEMENT AFTER ALL THE OFFSPRING ARE GENERATED DECREASES THE CONVERGENCE SPEED OF D-MAENS. SECOND, THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THESE SUB-PROBLEMS ARE REASSIGNED AT EACH GENERATION BY ONLY CONSIDERING ONE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION. IN RESPONSE TO THESE ISSUES, THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN IMPROVED D-MAENS FOR MULTI-OBJECTIVE CARP (ID-MAENS). THE TWO IMPROVEMENTS OF THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM ARE AS FOLLOWS: (1) THE REPLACEMENT OF THE SOLUTIONS IS IMMEDIATELY DONE ONCE AN OFFSPRING IS GENERATED, WHICH REFERENCES TO THE STEADY-STATE EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM. THE NEW OFFSPRING WILL ACCELERATE THE CONVERGENCE SPEED, (2) ELITISM IS IMPLEMENTED BY USING AN ARCHIVE TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT BEST SOLUTION IN ITS DECOMPOSITION DIRECTION DURING THE SEARCH, AND THESE ELITE SOLUTIONS CAN PROVIDE HELPFUL INFORMATION FOR SOLVING THEIR NEIGHBOR SUB-PROBLEMS BY COOPERATION. COMPARED WITH THE MULTI-OBJECTIVE CARP ALGORITHM, EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON LARGE-SCALE BENCHMARK INSTANCES EGL SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM HAS PERFORMED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN D-MAENS ON 23 OUT OF THE TOTAL 24 INSTANCES. MOREOVER, ID-MAENS FIND ALL THE BEST NONDOMINATED SOLUTIONS ON 13 EGL INSTANCES. IN THE LAST SECTION OF THIS PAPER, THE ID-MAENS ALSO PROVES TO BE COMPETITIVE TO SOME STATE-OF-ART SINGLE-OBJECTIVE CARP ALGORITHMS IN TERMS OF QUALITY OF SOLUTIONS AND COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY.

"GRANDINETTI L, 2012, COMPUT OPER RES",AN OPTIMIZATION-BASED HEURISTIC FOR THE MULTI-OBJECTIVE UNDIRECTED CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM,"THE MULTI-OBJECTIVE UNDIRECTED CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM (MUCARP) IS THE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM AIMED AT FINDING THE BEST STRATEGY FOR SERVICING A SUBSET OF CLIENTS LOCALIZED ALONG THE LINKS OF A LOGISTIC NETWORK, BY USING A FLEET OF VEHICLES AND OPTIMIZING MORE THAN ONE OBJECTIVE. IN GENERAL, THE FIRST GOAL CONSISTS IN MINIMIZING THE TOTAL TRANSPORTATION COST, AND IN THIS CASE THE PROBLEM BRINGS BACK TO THE WELL-KNOWN UNDIRECTED CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM (UCARP). THE MOTIVATION BEHIND THE STUDY OF THE MUCARP LIES IN THE STUDY OF REAL SITUATIONS WHERE COMPANIES WORKING IN THE LOGISTIC DISTRIBUTION FIELD DEAL WITH COMPLEX OPERATIONAL STRATEGIES, IN WHICH DIFFERENT ACTORS (TRUCKS, DRIVERS, CUSTOMERS) HAVE TO BE ALLOCATED WITHIN AN UNIFIED FRAMEWORK BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT OPPOSITE NEEDS AND DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS. ALL THE PREVIOUS CONSIDERATIONS LEAD TO THE MUCARP AS A BENCHMARK OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM FOR MODELING PRACTICAL SITUATIONS. IN THIS PAPER, THE MUCARP IS HEURISTICALLY TACKLED. IN PARTICULAR, THREE COMPETITIVE OBJECTIVES ARE MINIMIZED AT THE SAME TIME: THE TOTAL TRANSPORTATION COST, THE LONGEST ROUTE COST (MAKESPAN) AND THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES (I.E., THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ROUTES). AN APPROXIMATION OF THE OPTIMAL PARETO FRONT IS DETERMINED THROUGH AN OPTIMIZATION-BASED HEURISTIC PROCEDURE. WHOSE PERFORMANCES ARE TESTED AND ANALYZED ON CLASSICAL BENCHMARK INSTANCES.

"MEI Y, 2011, IEEE TRANS EVOL COMPUT",DECOMPOSITION-BASED MEMETIC ALGORITHM FOR MULTIOBJECTIVE CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM,"THE CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM (CARP) IS A CHALLENGING COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM WITH MANY REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS, E. G., SALTING ROUTE OPTIMIZATION AND FLEET MANAGEMENT. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY ATTEMPTS AT SOLVING CARP USING HEURISTIC AND META-HEURISTIC APPROACHES, INCLUDING EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS. HOWEVER, ALMOST ALL SUCH ATTEMPTS FORMULATE CARP AS A SINGLE-OBJECTIVE PROBLEM ALTHOUGH IT USUALLY HAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECTIVE, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING ITS REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS. THIS PAPER STUDIES MULTIOBJECTIVE CARP (MO-CARP). A NEW MEMETIC ALGORITHM (MA) CALLED DECOMPOSITION-BASED MA WITH EXTENDED NEIGHBORHOOD SEARCH (D-MAENS) IS PROPOSED. THE NEW ALGORITHM COMBINES THE ADVANCED FEATURES FROM BOTH THE MAENS APPROACH FOR SINGLE-OBJECTIVE CARP AND MULTIOBJECTIVE EVOLUTIONARY OPTIMIZATION. OUR EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT SUCH COMBINATION OUTPERFORMS SIGNIFICANTLY AN OFF-THE-SHELF MULTIOBJECTIVE EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM, NAMELY NONDOMINATED SORTING GENETIC ALGORITHM II, AND THE STATE-OF-THE-ART MULTIOBJECTIVE ALGORITHM FOR MO-CARP (LMOGA).

"SHANG R, 2016, APPL SOFT COMPUT",IMMUNE CLONAL ALGORITHM BASED ON DIRECTED EVOLUTION FOR MULTI-OBJECTIVE CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM,"THE CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM IS PLAYING AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN OUR SOCIETY, ENGENDERING INCREASING ATTENTION FROM THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY. AMONG THE VARIOUS MODELS, MULTI-OBJECTIVE CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM COMES MUCH CLOSER TO REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER PROPOSES AN IMMUNE CLONAL ALGORITHM BASED ON DIRECTED EVOLUTION TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. FIRSTLY, THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM ADOPTS THE FRAMEWORK OF THE IMMUNE CLONAL ALGORITHM AND EXPANDS THE SCALE OF THE INITIAL ANTIBODY POPULATION IN THE INITIALIZATION PROCESS TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF THE ANTIBODIES. SECONDLY, THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM IS COMBINED WITH A DECOMPOSITION STRATEGY IN THE OPERATIONS OF THE IMMUNE GENE. ANTIBODIES ARE CLASSIFIED TO PERFORM THE IMMUNE GENETIC OPERATIONS, WHICH HELPS THE ANTIBODY POPULATIONS TO SHARE THE NEIGHBORHOOD INFORMATION IN A TIMELY MANNER. THIRDLY, THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM APPLIES A NOVEL KIND OF COMPARISON OPERATOR TO BUILD THE TOTAL POPULATION, WHICH HELPS IT TO EVOLVE IN THE DIRECTION OF A BETTER POPULATION AND IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF THE ANTIBODIES. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM CAN GENERATE BETTER NON-DOMINANT SOLUTIONS THAN SEVERAL COMPARED STATE-OF-THE-ART ALGORITHMS, ESPECIALLY FOR LARGE-SCALE SETS.

THIS PAPER BUILDS ON, AND DEVELOPS BEYOND, THE COOPERATIVE COEVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM BASED ON ROUTE DISTANCE GROUPING (RDG-MAENS), RECENTLY PROPOSED BY MEI ET AL. ALTHOUGH MEI'S METHOD HAS PROVED SUPERIOR TO PREVIOUS ALGORITHMS, WE DISCUSS SEVERAL REMAINING DRAWBACKS AND PROPOSE SOLUTIONS TO OVERCOME THEM. FIRST, ALTHOUGH RDG IS USED IN SEARCHING FOR POTENTIAL BETTER SOLUTIONS, THE SOLUTION GENERATED FROM THE DECOMPOSED PROBLEM AT EACH GENERATION IS NOT THE BEST ONE, AND THE BEST SOLUTION FOUND SO FAR IS NOT USED FOR SOLVING THE CURRENT GENERATION. SECOND, TO DETERMINE WHICH SUB-POPULATION THE INDIVIDUAL BELONGS TO SIMPLY ACCORDING TO THE DISTANCE CAN LEAD TO AN IMBALANCE IN THE NUMBER OF THE INDIVIDUALS AMONG DIFFERENT SUB-POPULATIONS AND THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES. THIRD, THE METHOD OF MEI ET AL. WAS ONLY USED TO SOLVE SINGLE-OBJECTIVE CARP. TO OVERCOME THE ABOVE ISSUES, THIS PAPER PROPOSES IMPROVING RDG-MAENS BY UPDATING THE SOLUTIONS IMMEDIATELY AND APPLYING THEM TO SOLVE THE CURRENT SOLUTION THROUGH AREAS SHARED, AND THEN ACCORDING TO THE MAGNITUDE OF THE VECTOR OF THE ROUTE DIRECTION, AND A FAST AND SIMPLE ALLOCATION SCHEME IS PROPOSED TO DETERMINE WHICH DECOMPOSED PROBLEM THE ROUTE BELONGS TO. FINALLY, WE COMBINE THE IMPROVED ALGORITHM WITH AN IMPROVED DECOMPOSITION-BASED MEMETIC ALGORITHM TO SOLVE THE MULTIOBJECTIVE LARGE SCALE CARP (LSCARP). EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE PROPOSED IMPROVED ALGORITHM CAN ACHIEVE BETTER RESULTS ON BOTH SINGLE-OBJECTIVE LSCARP AND MULTIOBJECTIVE LSCARP.",1,0,1,1,Bi-objective Capacitated Arc Routing Problem,Bi-objective Capacitated Arc Routing Problem,,,

IN ADDITION TO THE TOTAL ROUTE LENGTH (THE ONLY CRITERION MINIMIZED IN THE ACADEMIC PROBLEM), WASTE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES SEEK TO MINIMIZE ALSO THE LENGTH OF THE LONGEST TRIP. IN THIS PAPER, A BI-OBJECTIVE GENETIC ALGORITHM IS PRESENTED FOR THIS MORE REALISTIC CARP, NEVER STUDIED BEFORE IN LITERATURE. BASED ON THE NSGA-II TEMPLATE, IT INCLUDES TWO-KEY FEATURES: USE OF GOOD CONSTRUCTIVE HEURISTICS TO SEED THE INITIAL POPULATION AND HYBRIDIZATION WITH A POWERFUL LOCAL SEARCH PROCEDURE. THIS GENETIC ALGORITHM IS APPRAISED ON 23 CLASSICAL CARP INSTANCES, WITH EXCELLENT RESULTS.

ALTHOUGH MCGRP GENERALIZES MANY OTHER ROUTING PROBLEMS AND YIELDS BETTER MODELS FOR SEVERAL PRACTICAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS NEWSPAPER DELIVERY AND URBAN WASTE COLLECTION, THIS IS STILL AN UNDERINVESTIGATED PROBLEM. FURTHERMORE, MOST OF THE STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE OPTIMIZATION OF JUST ONE OBJECTIVE, THAT IS, COST MINIMIZATION. KEEPING IN MIND THE REQUIREMENT OF INDUSTRIES NOWADAYS, MCGRP HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IN THIS PAPER TO CONCURRENTLY OPTIMIZE TWO CRUCIAL OBJECTIVES, NAMELY, MINIMIZATION OF ROUTING COST AND ROUTE IMBALANCE. TO SOLVE THIS BI-OBJECTIVE FORM OF MCGRP, A MULTI-OBJECTIVE EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM (MOEA), COINED AS MEMETIC NSGA-II, HAS BEEN DESIGNED. IT IS A HYBRID OF NON-DOMINATED SORTING GENETIC ALGORITHM-II (NSGA-II), A DOMINANCE BASED LOCAL SEARCH PROCEDURE (DBLSP), AND A CLONE MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLE (CMP). THE DBLSP AND CMP HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE FRAMEWORK OF NSGA-II WITH A VIEW TO EMPOWERING ITS CAPABILITY TO CONVERGE AT/OR NEAR THE TRUE PARETO FRONT AND BOOSTING DIVERSITY AMONG THE TRADE-OFF SOLUTIONS, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE ALGORITHM ALSO CONTAINS A SET OF THREE WELL-KNOWN CROSSOVER OPERATORS (X-SET) THAT ARE EMPLOYED TO EXPLORE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SEARCH SPACE. THE ALGORITHM WAS TESTED ON A STANDARD BENCHMARK OF TWENTY THREE STANDARD MCGRP INSTANCES OF VARYING COMPLEXITY. THE COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENTS VERIFY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MEMETIC NSGA-II AND ALSO SHOW THE ENERGETIC EFFECTS OF USING DBLSP, CMP AND X-SET TOGETHER WHILE FINDING THE SET OF POTENTIALLY PARETO OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS.",1,0,1,1,Bi-objective Mixed General Routing Problem,Bi-objective Mixed Capacitated General Routing Problem,,,

WE STUDY A BI-OBJECTIVE VARIANT OF THE PROBLEM, IN WHICH, IN ADDITION TO SEEKING A SET OF ROUTES OF LOW COST, ONE SIMULTANEOUSLY SEEKS A SET OF ROUTES IN WHICH THE WORK LOAD IS BALANCED. DUE TO THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE OBJECTIVES, FINDING A SOLUTION THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY OPTIMIZES BOTH OBJECTIVES IS USUALLY IMPOSSIBLE. THUS, WE SEEK TO GENERATE MANY OR ALL EFFICIENT, OR PARETO-OPTIMAL, SOLUTIONS, I.E., SOLUTIONS IN WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO IMPROVE THE VALUE OF ONE OBJECTIVE WITHOUT DETERIORATION IN THE VALUE OF THE OTHER OBJECTIVE. ROUTE BALANCE CAN BE MODELED IN DIFFERENT WAYS, AND A COMPUTATIONAL STUDY USING SMALL BENCHMARK INSTANCES OF THE MIXED CAPACITATED GENERAL ROUTING PROBLEM DEMONSTRATES THAT THE CHOICE OF ROUTE BALANCE MODELING HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE NUMBER AND DIVERSITY OF PARETO-OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS. THE RESULTS OF THE COMPUTATIONAL STUDY SUGGEST THAT MODELING ROUTE BALANCE IN TERMS OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LONGEST AND SHORTEST ROUTE IN A SOLUTION IS A ROBUST CHOICE THAT PERFORMS WELL ACROSS A VARIETY OF INSTANCES.

THE PROBABILISTIC MEMETIC FRAMEWORK (PMF) WAS THUS INTRODUCED TO MODEL MA AS A PROCESS INVOLVING THE DECISION OF EMBRACING THE SEPARATE ACTIONS OF GLOBAL OR LOCAL SEARCH.

NUMEROUS APPROACHES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM. MOST OF THESE METHODS, ALBEIT SHOWING GOOD PERFORMANCE ON CARP INSTANCES OF SMALL AND MEDIAN SIZES, DO NOT SCALE WELL TO LARGE-SCALE CARPS, E.G., TAKING AT LEAST A FEW HOURS TO ACHIEVE A SATISFACTORY SOLUTION ON A CARP INSTANCE WITH THOUSANDS OF TASKS. IN THIS PAPER, AN EFFICIENT AND SCALABLE APPROACH IS PROPOSED FOR CARPS. THE KEY IDEA OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS TO HIERARCHICALLY DECOMPOSE THE TASKS INVOLVED IN A CARP INSTANCE INTO SUBGROUPS AND SOLVE THE INDUCED SUBPROBLEMS RECURSIVELY. THE OUTPUT OF THE SUBPROBLEMS AT THE LOWER LAYER IN THE HIERARCHY IS TREATED AS VIRTUAL TASKS AND NEW SUBPROBLEMS ARE FORMULATED BASED ON THESE VIRTUAL TASKS USING CLUSTERING TECHNIQUES. BY THIS MEANS, THE NUMBER OF TASKS (OR VIRTUAL TASKS) DECREASES RAPIDLY FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP LAYERS OF THE HIERARCHY, AND THE SIZES OF ALL SUBPROBLEMS AT EACH LAYER CAN BE KEPT TRACTABLE EVEN FOR VERY LARGE-SCALE CARPS. EMPIRICAL STUDIES ARE CONDUCTED ON CARP INSTANCES WITH UP TO 3584 TASKS, WHICH ARE AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE LARGER THAN THE NUMBER OF TASKS INVOLVED IN ALL CARP INSTANCES INVESTIGATED IN THE LITERATURE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED APPROACH SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMS EXISTING METHODS IN TERMS OF SCALABILITY.

IN THE CARP, THE CUSTOMERS' DEMANDS ARE LOCATED ON THE EDGES (ARCS) OF A GENERAL (NOT NECESSARILY COMPLETE) GRAPH. THIS IS IN CONTRAST TO THE CVRP, WHERE DEMAND IS LOCATED ON THE NODES OF A COMPLETE GRAPH. WHILE THE CVRP HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DECADES, THE NUMBER OF ARTICLES AND RESEARCH RESULTS ON THE CARP IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER. TO PARTIALLY FILL THIS GAP IN THE LITERATURE, A NEW HEURISTIC AND TWO NEW ALGORITHMS FOR THE CARP ARE PROPOSED AND EVALUATED. OUR SAVINGS-BASED HEURISTIC FOR THE ARP (SHARP) IS INSPIRED ON THE POPULAR CLARKE AND WRIGHT SAVINGS HEURISTIC FOR THE CVRP. THE SHARP PROCEDURE OUTPERFORMS THE CLASSICAL PATH SCANNING HEURISTIC (PSH) AND THUS IT CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO MOST META-HEURISTICS TO PROVIDE A `GOOD' AND FAST INITIAL SOLUTION TO MEDIUM-TO-LARGE SIZE ARPS WHICH CANNOT BE SOLVED USING EXACT APPROACHES. USING BOTH SHARP AND PSH AS A BASE, TWO RANDOMIZED ALGORITHMS ARE DEVELOPED IN THIS PAPER. THESE ARE MULTI-START ALGORITHMS WHICH INTRODUCE A BIASED RANDOMIZATION PROCESS TO EACH HEURISTIC. THIS RANDOMIZATION PROCESS USES BIASED PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS, SUCH AS THE GEOMETRIC ONE, IN ORDER TO INDUCE SOME DEGREE OF RANDOMNESS IN THE SOLUTION-CONSTRUCTION STAGE WHILE KEEPING MOST OF THE HEURISTIC `COMMON SENSE'.

WE INTERPRET AS A DIRECTION OF GROWTH FROM THE ORIGIN , IS THE INTERSECTION POINT BETWEEN AND THE POLYTOPE BOUNDARY. TO EASE THE EXPOSITION, THE FIRST PART OF THE PAPER IS DEVOTED TO THE GENERAL CONTEXT OF A (PRIMAL OR DUAL) POLYTOPE WITH RATIONAL DATA SUCH THAT: (I) THE INTERSECTION SUB-PROBLEM CAN BE EFFECTIVELY SOLVED IN PRACTICE FOR INPUT RAYS AND (II) IS FEASIBLE. BY ITERATING OVER SUCH RAYS , OUR METHOD PRODUCES A SEQUENCE OF FEASIBLE SOLUTIONS THAT WE PROVE TO BE FINITELY CONVERGENT. FROM SECTION 3 ON, WE FOCUS ON DUAL POLYTOPES IN CG FORMULATIONS. TYPICALLY, IF THE CG (SEPARATION) SUB-PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED BY DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING (DP), SO CAN BE THE INTERSECTION SUB-PROBLEM. THE PROPOSED INTEGER RAY METHOD (IRM) ONLY USES INTEGER RAYS, AND SO, THE INTERSECTION SUB-PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED USING A DP SCHEME BASED ON STATES INDEXED BY INTEGER RAY VALUES.

IN MOST AREAS, THE SEVERITY OF WINTER CONDITIONS VARIES FROM YEAR TO YEAR. MODERN SOCIETY HAS BECOME MORE VULNERABLE TO THESE EFFECTS. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF WINTER MAINTENANCE IS TO PROVIDE SNOW AND ICE-FREE CONDITIONS ON THE HIGHWAY NETWORK. COMPARED WITH OTHER ROAD ACTIVITIES, WINTER MAINTENANCE IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE NEED FOR A FAST RESPONSE, AND BY THE IMPACTS OF THE MEASURES TAKEN BEING SHORT-LIVED. THAT IS WHY SCIENTIFICALLY BASED METHODOLOGY (OPTIMISATION OF WINTER MAINTENANCE TECHNIQUES) IS NEEDED TO REDUCE THE ABOVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. THE MAIN AIM OF THE RESEARCH WORK CARRIED OUT AT KTI NON-PROFIT LTD, BUDAPEST WAS TO OPTIMISE THE EFFICIENCY AND THE TIMING OF SALT STORAGE AND ROAD DE-ICING POLICY AS A FUNCTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC AND TRAFFIC SAFETY ASPECTS. THE SELECTED METHODOLOGY, CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM HELPS THE ROAD MANAGING AGENCIES IN OPTIMISING ROAD WINTER MAINTENANCE FLEET ROUTING, WITH REDUCED AIR POLLUTION, FUEL CONSUMPTION, IN ACCELERATING THE RELATED ACTIVITIES, BESIDES IN REDUCING ROAD USER COSTS SIGNIFICANTLY. IN THE RESEARCH WORK PERFORMED SEVERAL SCENARIOS ON DIFFERENT DECENTRALISATION LEVELS OF SALT STORAGE DEPOTS WERE ALSO MODELLED, AND INVESTIGATED FROM ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC VIEW-POINTS. THE SCENARIO ON HEAVY DE-ICING VEHICLES OF STANDARD LOAD CAPACITIES WITH A CENTRALIZED DEPOT WAS CONSIDERED AS STANDARD VARIANT, WHILE THE HEAVY VEHICLES OF VARIABLE LOAD CAPACITIES AND THE SILOS WITH UNLIMITED CAPACITIES WERE ALSO MODELLED. A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THE TIMING OF SALT DEPOT DECENTRALISATION PROVED THAT THE IMMEDIATE SET-UP OF SILOS IS THE MOST ECONOMIC AND EFFICIENT VARIANT.

USING A RECENT BRANCH-AND-CUT-AND-PRICE ALGORITHM FOR THE CVRP, WE OBSERVED THAT IT YIELDS AN EFFECTIVE WAY OF ATTACKING THE CARP, BEING SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN THE EXACT METHODS CREATED SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT PROBLEM. COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENTS OBTAINED IMPROVED LOWER BOUNDS FOR ALMOST ALL OPEN INSTANCES FROM THE LITERATURE. SEVERAL SUCH INSTANCES COULD BE SOLVED TO OPTIMALITY. SCOPE AND PURPOSE THE SCOPE OF THIS PAPER IS TRANSFORMING ARC ROUTING PROBLEMS INTO NODE ROUTING PROBLEMS.

A COMPLETE SENSOR-BASED COVERAGE PATH PLAN FOR THE ROBOT TEAM CAN BE OBTAINED BY USING THE CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM SOLUTION METHODS ON THE GVD-BASED GRAPH.

FIVE COMMONLY USED ARC ROUTING MOVE OPERATORS WERE ADAPTED FOR THE PROBLEM, AND BASIC LOCAL SEARCH IMPLEMENTATIONS WERE TESTED ON WASTE COLLECTION BENCHMARK SETS. TESTS SHOWED THAT DESPITE THE APPLICATION OF COMMONLY USED SPEED-UP TECHNIQUES, THE LOCAL SEARCH IMPLEMENTATIONS ARE VERY SLOW ON LARGE TEST INSTANCES WITH MORE THAN ONE-THOUSAND REQUIRED ARCS AND EDGES. IN RESPONSE, MORE ADVANCED LOCAL SEARCH ACCELERATION MECHANISMS FROM LITERATURE WERE ADAPTED AND COMBINED FOR THE MCARPTIF AND TESTED ON THE SAME INSTANCES. ON THE LARGE INSTANCES, THE BASIC LOCAL SEARCH SETUPS TOOK BETWEEN 15 MIN AND 3 H TO IMPROVE A SINGLE SOLUTION TO LOCAL OPTIMA, WHEREAS THE ACCELERATED IMPLEMENTATIONS TOOK AT MOST 4 MIN WHILE PRODUCING SIMILAR QUALITY LOCAL OPTIMA. THE BEST PERFORMING IMPLEMENTATION MADE USE OF TWO EXISTING ACCELERATION MECHANISMS, NAMELY STATIC-MOVE-DESCRIPTORS AND GREEDY-COMPOUND-INDEPENDENT-MOVES.

THIS PAPER EVALUATES FOUR CONSTRUCTIVE HEURISTICS CAPABLE OF COMPUTING FEASIBLE SOLUTIONS FOR THE MCARPTIF WITH A PRIMARY OBJECTIVE TO EITHER MINIMISE TOTAL COST OR TO MINIMISE THE FLEET SIZE. THE HEURISTICS WERE ADAPTED FROM PATH-SCANNING AND IMPROVED-MERGE FOR THE MIXED CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM, AND COMPARED AGAINST TWO ROUTE-FIRST-CLUSTER-SECOND HEURISTICS FOR THE MCARPTIF. THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO IDENTIFY THE BEST PERFORMING HEURISTIC FOR APPLICATION PURPOSES. IN PRACTICE, THE CARP IS OFTEN SOLVED FOR REAL-TIME OR NEAR REAL-TIME DECISION SUPPORT. COMPUTATIONAL TIME REQUIRED BY THE HEURISTICS WAS THUS ALSO EVALUATED. IDENTIFYING THE BEST HEURISTIC PROVED DIFFICULT DUE TO A LACK OF REALISTIC MCARPTIF BENCHMARK SETS, WITH THE TWO CLARPIF SETS PREDOMINANTLY SOLVED IN THE LITERATURE NOT RESEMBLING ACTUAL WASTE COLLECTION INSTANCES. ROUTE-FIRST-CLUSTER-SECOND HEURISTICS, LINKED WITH A NEW VEHICLE REDUCTION HEURISTIC PERFORMED THE WORST ON THE TWO CLARPIF SETS, YET PERFORMED THE BEST ON NEW WASTE COLLECTION SETS TAKEN FROM THE LITERATURE AND INTRODUCED IN THIS PAPER. IMPROVED-MERGE PERFORMED THE BEST ON TWO EXISTING CLARPIF SETS AND ON A REALISTIC SET WITH INTERMEDIATE-FACILITIES INCIDENT WITH THE VEHICLE DEPOT, BUT STRUGGLED ON ALL OTHER SETS AND IN MINIMISING FLEET SIZE. PATH-SCANNING WAS THE MOST ROBUST HEURISTIC, PERFORMING REASONABLY WELL ON ALL BENCHMARK SETS AND BOTH OBJECTIVES. RESULTS FURTHER SHOW THAT DUE TO THE HIGH COMPUTATIONAL TIME OF ONE OF THE ROUTE-FIRST-CLUSTER-SECOND HEURISTICS, WHICH WAS ONLY EXPOSED ON REALISTICALLY SIZED SETS, THE SLIGHTLY WORSE VERSION IS THE BEST ALTERNATIVE WHEN REAL-TIME SUPPORT IS REQUIRED FOR WASTE COLLECTION APPLICATIONS.

"ZHANG Y, 2017, APPL SOFT COMPUT",MEMETIC ALGORITHM WITH ROUTE DECOMPOSING FOR PERIODIC CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM,"IN THIS PAPER,HE PERIODIC CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM (PCARP) IS INVESTIGATED. PCARP IS AN EXTENSIONOF THE WELL-KNOWN CARP FROM A SINGLE PERIOD TO A MULTI-PERIOD HORIZON. IN PCARP, TWO OBJECTIVES ARE TOBE MINIMIZED. ONE IS THE NUMBER OF REQUIRED VEHICLES (NV), AND THE OTHER IS THE TOTAL COST (TC). DUE TO THE MULTI-PERIOD NATURE, GIVEN THE SAME GRAPH OR ROAD NETWORK, PCARP CAN HAVE A MUCH LARGER SOLUTION SPACE THAN THE SINGLE-PERIOD CARP COUNTERPART. FURTHERMORE, PCARP CONSISTS OF AN ADDITIONAL ALLOCATION SUB-PROBLEM (OF THE DAYS TO SERVE THE ARCS), WHICH IS INTERDEPENDENT WITH THE ROUTING SUB-PROBLEM. ALTHOUGH SOME ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR SOLVING PCARP, MORE INVESTIGATIONS ARE YET TO BE DONE TO FURTHER IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE ESPECIALLY ON LARGE-SCALE PROBLEM INSTANCES. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT OPTIMIZING NV AND TC SEPARATELY (HIERARCHICALLY) IS A GOOD WAY OF DEALING WITH THE TWO OBJECTIVES. IN THIS PAPER, WE FURTHER IMPROVE THIS STRATEGY AND PROPOSE A NEW ROUTE DECOMPOSITION (RD) OPERATORTHEREBY. THEN, THE RD OPERATOR IS INTEGRATED INTO A MEMETIC ALGORITHM (MA) FRAMEWORK FOR PCARP, IN WHICH NOVEL CROSSOVER AND LOCAL SEARCH OPERATORS ARE DESIGNED ACCORDINGLY. IN ADDITION, TO IMPROVE THE SEARCH EFFICIENCY, A HYBRIDIZED INITIALIZATION IS EMPLOYED TO GENERATE AN INITIAL POPULATION CONSISTING OF BOTH HEURISTIC AND RANDOM INDIVIDUALS.

WE OBTAIN CLOSE FORM EXPRESSIONS AND ILLUSTRATE HOW ALLOCATING BANDWIDTH FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL MEASUREMENT (CASE-1) PERFORMS COMPARED TO ALLOCATING IT FOR EACH DESIRED STATISTIC (CASE-2) IN DIFFERENT BOTTLENECK SITUATIONS. THEN, WE EXTEND THIS SCENARIO TO THE CASE WHERE WE OPTIMALLY SELECT A NUMBER OF AGGREGATORS FROM A CLOUD OF SENSOR NODES. IN THIS SECOND SCENARIO, UNDER WELL DEFINED BANDWIDTH CONSTRAINTS, WE LOOK AT THE OPTIMUM CLUSTERING PROBLEM, IN WHICH THE GOAL IS TO SELECT THE BEST AGGREGATION NODES TO MINIMIZE THE TOTAL DISTORTION OF THE DESIRED STATISTICS AT THE REMOTE CONTROL NODE. WE PROVIDE AN ALGORITHMIC SOLUTION THAT RETURNS THE OPTIMUM AGGREGATION POINTS AND THE OPTIMUM SIZE OF EACH CLUSTER UNDER SOME MILD ASSUMPTIONS. WE FINALLY TURN OUR ATTENTION TO THE GENERAL ROUTING PROBLEM AND PROVIDE AN ALGORITHM THAT PERFORMS ROUTING AND BANDWIDTH ALLOCATION JOINTLY.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS A METHOD FOR EXTENDING THIS APPROACH TO PROBLEMS SUCH AS CAPACITATED P-MEDIAN, DISTANCE CONSTRAINED GENERAL ROUTING AND RELATED VARIANTS (E.G., CAPACITATED ARC-ROUTING).
