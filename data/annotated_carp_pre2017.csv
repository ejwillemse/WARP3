THE BALANCE OF GLOBAL AND LOCAL SEARCH IN MA PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN DEFINING THE PERFORMANCE OF MA IN PROBLEM SOLVING. THE PROBABILISTIC MEMETIC FRAMEWORK (PMF) WAS THUS INTRODUCED TO MODEL MA AS A PROCESS INVOLVING THE DECISION OF EMBRACING THE SEPARATE ACTIONS OF GLOBAL OR LOCAL SEARCH. PMF BALANCES THESE TWO ACTIONS BY GOVERNING THE LOCAL SEARCH INTENSITY OF EACH INDIVIDUAL BASED ON A THEORETICAL UPPER BOUND DERIVED WHILE THE SEARCH PROGRESSES. TO USE PMF FOR SOLVING COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS, ACCORDING TO OUR PREVIOUS STUDY [1], WE NOTE THAT THE APPROPRIATE SELECTION OF A DISTANCE METRIC FOR ESTIMATING THE LOCAL SEARCH INTENSITY IS A CRITICAL ROLE. NEVERTHELESS, TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, LITTLE OR NO RESEARCH WORKS IN THE LITERATURE HAS STUDIED ON SUITABLE DISTANCE METRIC FOR PMF IN THE CONTEXT OF COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS. IN THIS PAPER, WE ATTEMPT TO FILL THIS GAP BY PRESENTING A PRELIMINARY STUDY ON THE SELECTION OF DISTANCE METRIC IN PMF FOR CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM (CARP). IN PARTICULAR, WE FIRST ANALYZE THE SUITABILITY OF 4 EXISTING POPULAR DISTANCE METRICS USED IN COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION FOR SOLVING CARP. SUBSEQUENTLY A SCORE BASED ON CLOSENESS OF NEIGHBORHOOD AND FITNESS LANDSCAPE CORRELATION IS PROPOSED TO QUANTIFY THE SUITABILITY OF A DISTANCE METRIC IN ESTIMATING THE LOCAL SEARCH INTENSITY FOR PMF IN THE CONTEXT OF COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION.

"TANG K, 2017, IEEE T CYBERN",A SCALABLE APPROACH TO CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEMS BASED ON HIERARCHICAL DECOMPOSITION,"THE CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM (CARP) IS A CHALLENGING OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM WITH LOTS OF APPLICATIONS IN THE REAL WORLD. NUMEROUS APPROACHES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM. MOST OF THESE METHODS, ALBEIT SHOWING GOOD PERFORMANCE ON CARP INSTANCES OF SMALL AND MEDIAN SIZES, DO NOT SCALE WELL TO LARGE-SCALE CARPS, E.G., TAKING AT LEAST A FEW HOURS TO ACHIEVE A SATISFACTORY SOLUTION ON A CARP INSTANCE WITH THOUSANDS OF TASKS. IN THIS PAPER, AN EFFICIENT AND SCALABLE APPROACH IS PROPOSED FOR CARPS. THE KEY IDEA OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS TO HIERARCHICALLY DECOMPOSE THE TASKS INVOLVED IN A CARP INSTANCE INTO SUBGROUPS AND SOLVE THE INDUCED SUBPROBLEMS RECURSIVELY. THE OUTPUT OF THE SUBPROBLEMS AT THE LOWER LAYER IN THE HIERARCHY IS TREATED AS VIRTUAL TASKS AND NEW SUBPROBLEMS ARE FORMULATED BASED ON THESE VIRTUAL TASKS USING CLUSTERING TECHNIQUES. BY THIS MEANS, THE NUMBER OF TASKS (OR VIRTUAL TASKS) DECREASES RAPIDLY FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP LAYERS OF THE HIERARCHY, AND THE SIZES OF ALL SUBPROBLEMS AT EACH LAYER CAN BE KEPT TRACTABLE EVEN FOR VERY LARGE-SCALE CARPS. EMPIRICAL STUDIES ARE CONDUCTED ON CARP INSTANCES WITH UP TO 3584 TASKS, WHICH ARE AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE LARGER THAN THE NUMBER OF TASKS INVOLVED IN ALL CARP INSTANCES INVESTIGATED IN THE LITERATURE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED APPROACH SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMS EXISTING METHODS IN TERMS OF SCALABILITY. SINCE THE PROPOSED HIERARCHICAL DECOMPOSITION SCHEME IS DESIGNED TO OBTAIN A GOOD PERMUTATION OF TASKS IN A CARP INSTANCE, IT MAY ALSO BE GENERALIZED TO OTHER HARD OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS THAT CAN BE FORMULATED AS PERMUTATION-BASED OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS.",1,0,1,0,Capacitated Arc Routing Problem,Capacitated Arc Routing Problem,,Large scale problems,,CANDIDA MOURAO M;PINTO LS,2017,AN UPDATED ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY ON ARC ROUTING PROBLEMS,NETWORKS

THE FIRST PHASE EXECUTES THE GROUPING OF ARCS BASED ON AN ADAPTED MODEL OF THE P-MEDIAN PROBLEM, FORMULATED AS A PROBLEM OF BINARY INTEGER LINEAR PROGRAMMING (BILP). THE SECOND PHASE REFERS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MODEL FOR THE SOLUTION TO THE CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM (CARP), FORMULATED AS A MIXED INTEGER LINEAR PROGRAMMING (MILP) PROBLEM. THE THIRD PHASE CARRIES OUT THE APPLICATION OF AN ADAPTED ALGORITHM OF HIERHOLZER FOR SEQUENCING THE ARCS OBTAINED IN THE PRECEDING PHASE. THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY WAS TESTED USING REAL DATA AND EFFICIENTLY SOLVED THE PROBLEM. THE RESULTS LED TO A REDUCTION IN THE DISTANCES TRAVELED BY TRUCKS, WHICH COULD PROMOTE MONEY SAVINGS FOR THE PUBLIC COFFERS, AS WELL AS A REDUCTION IN CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS.

A NUMBER OF OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED OVER THE YEARS TO SOLVE BASIC CARPS AND THEIR PERFORMANCE HAVE BEEN ANALYZED USING SELECTED BENCHMARK SUITES AVAILABLE IN LITERATURE. FROM AN APPLICATION POINT OF VIEW, THERE IS A NEED TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF ALGORITHMS ON SPECIFIC CLASS OF INSTANCES THAT RESEMBLE REALISTIC APPLICATIONS, E.G., INSPECTION OF ELECTRIC POWER LINES, GARBAGE COLLECTION, WINTER GRITTING ETC.

IT ALLOWS GENERATION OF ROAD NETWORKS WITH MULTIPLE LANES, ONE-WAY/TWO-WAY ROADS AND VARYING DEGREE OF CONNECTEDNESS. FURTHERMORE, AN ALGORITHM CAPABLE OF SOLVING REAL LIFE CARP INSTANCES EFFICIENTLY WITHIN A FIXED COMPUTATIONAL BUDGET OF EVALUATIONS IS INTRODUCED.

INSTEAD OF CONSIDERING THE PROBLEM AS A WHOLE, THE PROPOSED APPROACH ADOPTS THE COOPERATIVE COEVOLUTION (CC) FRAMEWORK TO DECOMPOSE IT INTO SMALLER ONES AND SOLVE THEM SEPARATELY. AN EFFECTIVE DECOMPOSITION SCHEME CALLED THE ROUTE DISTANCE GROUPING (RDG) IS DEVELOPED TO DECOMPOSE THE PROBLEM. ITS MERIT IS TWOFOLD. FIRST, IT EMPLOYS THE ROUTE INFORMATION OF THE BEST-SO-FAR SOLUTION, SO THAT THE QUALITY OF THE DECOMPOSITION IS UPPER BOUNDED BY THAT OF THE BEST-SOFAR SOLUTION. THUS, IT CAN KEEP IMPROVING THE DECOMPOSITION BY UPDATING THE BEST-SO-FAR SOLUTION DURING THE SEARCH. SECOND, IT DEFINES A DISTANCE BETWEEN ROUTES, BASED ON WHICH THE POTENTIALLY BETTER DECOMPOSITIONS CAN BE IDENTIFIED. THEREFORE, RDG IS ABLE TO OBTAIN PROMISING DECOMPOSITIONS AND FOCUS THE SEARCH ON THE PROMISING REGIONS OF THE VAST SOLUTION SPACE. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES VERIFIED THE EFFICACY OF RDG ON THE INSTANCES WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF TASKS AND TIGHT CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, WHERE IT MANAGED TO OBTAIN SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER RESULTS THAN ITS COUNTERPART WITHOUT DECOMPOSITION IN A MUCH SHORTER TIME.

IN THE CARP, THE CUSTOMERS' DEMANDS ARE LOCATED ON THE EDGES (ARCS) OF A GENERAL (NOT NECESSARILY COMPLETE) GRAPH. THIS IS IN CONTRAST TO THE CVRP, WHERE DEMAND IS LOCATED ON THE NODES OF A COMPLETE GRAPH. WHILE THE CVRP HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DECADES, THE NUMBER OF ARTICLES AND RESEARCH RESULTS ON THE CARP IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER. TO PARTIALLY FILL THIS GAP IN THE LITERATURE, A NEW HEURISTIC AND TWO NEW ALGORITHMS FOR THE CARP ARE PROPOSED AND EVALUATED. OUR SAVINGS-BASED HEURISTIC FOR THE ARP (SHARP) IS INSPIRED ON THE POPULAR CLARKE AND WRIGHT SAVINGS HEURISTIC FOR THE CVRP. THE SHARP PROCEDURE OUTPERFORMS THE CLASSICAL PATH SCANNING HEURISTIC (PSH) AND THUS IT CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO MOST META-HEURISTICS TO PROVIDE A `GOOD' AND FAST INITIAL SOLUTION TO MEDIUM-TO-LARGE SIZE ARPS WHICH CANNOT BE SOLVED USING EXACT APPROACHES. USING BOTH SHARP AND PSH AS A BASE, TWO RANDOMIZED ALGORITHMS ARE DEVELOPED IN THIS PAPER. THESE ARE MULTI-START ALGORITHMS WHICH INTRODUCE A BIASED RANDOMIZATION PROCESS TO EACH HEURISTIC. THIS RANDOMIZATION PROCESS USES BIASED PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS, SUCH AS THE GEOMETRIC ONE, IN ORDER TO INDUCE SOME DEGREE OF RANDOMNESS IN THE SOLUTION-CONSTRUCTION STAGE WHILE KEEPING MOST OF THE HEURISTIC `COMMON SENSE'.

FIRSTLY, ESMAENS ADOPTS THE ROUTE DISTANCE GROUPING DECOMPOSITION SCHEME (RDG) TO DECOMPOSE THE LARGE-SCALE CARP INTO SOME INDEPENDENT SUB-PROBLEMS.

WE CALL AN ANTIBODY OF POPULATION QUANTUM BIT ENCODING, IN QICA-CARP. FOR THIS ENCODING, TO CONTROL THE POPULATION WITH A HIGH PROBABILITY EVOLUTION TOWARDS A GOOD SCHEMA WE USE THE INFORMATION ON THE CURRENT OPTIMAL ANTIBODY. THE MUTATION STRATEGY OF QUANTUM ROTATION GATE ACCELERATES THE CONVERGENCE OF THE ORIGINAL CLONE OPERATOR.

WE PRESENT A METHOD TO OPTIMIZE SUCH POLYTOPES USING THE FOLLOWING INTERSECTION SUB-PROBLEM: GIVEN RAY , FIND THE MAXIMUM SUCH THAT IS FEASIBLE. WE INTERPRET AS A DIRECTION OF GROWTH FROM THE ORIGIN , IS THE INTERSECTION POINT BETWEEN AND THE POLYTOPE BOUNDARY. TO EASE THE EXPOSITION, THE FIRST PART OF THE PAPER IS DEVOTED TO THE GENERAL CONTEXT OF A (PRIMAL OR DUAL) POLYTOPE WITH RATIONAL DATA SUCH THAT: (I) THE INTERSECTION SUB-PROBLEM CAN BE EFFECTIVELY SOLVED IN PRACTICE FOR INPUT RAYS AND (II) IS FEASIBLE. BY ITERATING OVER SUCH RAYS , OUR METHOD PRODUCES A SEQUENCE OF FEASIBLE SOLUTIONS THAT WE PROVE TO BE FINITELY CONVERGENT. FROM SECTION 3 ON, WE FOCUS ON DUAL POLYTOPES IN CG FORMULATIONS. TYPICALLY, IF THE CG (SEPARATION) SUB-PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED BY DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING (DP), SO CAN BE THE INTERSECTION SUB-PROBLEM. THE PROPOSED INTEGER RAY METHOD (IRM) ONLY USES INTEGER RAYS, AND SO, THE INTERSECTION SUB-PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED USING A DP SCHEME BASED ON STATES INDEXED BY INTEGER RAY VALUES. WE SHOW THAT UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS, THE INTERSECTION SUB-PROBLEM CAN BE EVEN EASIER THAN THE CG SUB-PROBLEM, ESPECIALLY WHEN NO OTHER INTEGER DATA IS AVAILABLE TO INDEX STATES IN DP, I.E., IF THE CG SUB-PROBLEM INPUT CONSISTS OF FRACTIONAL (OR LARGE-RANGE) VALUES. AS SUCH, THE IRM CAN TACKLE SCALED INSTANCES (WITH LARGE-RANGE WEIGHTS) OF CAPACITATED PROBLEMS THAT SEEM PROHIBITIVELY HARD FOR CLASSICAL CG.

USING A RECENT BRANCH-AND-CUT-AND-PRICE ALGORITHM FOR THE CVRP, WE OBSERVED THAT IT YIELDS AN EFFECTIVE WAY OF ATTACKING THE CARP, BEING SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN THE EXACT METHODS CREATED SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT PROBLEM. COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENTS OBTAINED IMPROVED LOWER BOUNDS FOR ALMOST ALL OPEN INSTANCES FROM THE LITERATURE. SEVERAL SUCH INSTANCES COULD BE SOLVED TO OPTIMALITY.

IN SENSOR-BASED COVERAGE OF NARROW SPACES, I.E., OBSTACLES LIE WITHIN THE SENSOR RANGE, A GENERALIZED VORONOI DIAGRAM (GVD)-BASED GRAPH CAN BE USED TO MODEL THE ENVIRONMENT. A COMPLETE SENSOR-BASED COVERAGE PATH PLAN FOR THE ROBOT TEAM CAN BE OBTAINED BY USING THE CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM SOLUTION METHODS ON THE GVD-BASED GRAPH. UNLIKE CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM, SENSOR-BASED COVERAGE PROBLEM REQUIRES TO CONSIDER TWO TYPES OF EDGE DEMANDS. THEREFORE, MODIFIED ULUSOY ALGORITHM IS USED TO OBTAIN MOBILE ROBOT TOURS BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT TWO DIFFERENT ENERGY CONSUMPTION CASES DURING SENSOR-BASED COVERAGE. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE PARTIALLY UNKNOWN NATURE OF THE ENVIRONMENT, THE ROBOTS MAY ENCOUNTER OBSTACLES ON THEIR TOURS. THIS REQUIRES A REPLANNING PROCESS THAT CONSIDERS THE REMAINING ENERGY CAPACITIES AND THE CURRENT POSITIONS OF THE ROBOTS. IN THIS PAPER, THE MODIFIED ULUSOY ALGORITHM IS EXTENDED TO INCORPORATE THIS DYNAMIC PLANNING PROBLEM. A DYNAMIC PATH-PLANNING APPROACH IS PROPOSED FOR MULTIROBOT SENSOR-BASED COVERAGE OF NARROW ENVIRONMENTS BY CONSIDERING THE ENERGY CAPACITIES OF THE MOBILE ROBOTS.

THE GENOTYPES OF THIS METHOD ARE CONSTRUCTIVE HEURISTICS SPECIFIED AS TREES OF MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS WHICH ARE EVOLVED WITH GENETIC PROGRAMMING (GP).

LOCAL INFORMATION SUCH AS THE VISITING COSTS FROM THE CURRENT POSITION, THE REMAINING LOAD OF THE VEHICLE, AND THE EDGE DEMANDS ARE AVAILABLE TO THE HEURISTIC. THE VIRTUAL VEHICLE THEN SERVES THE EDGE WITH THE LOWEST HEURISTIC VALUE AND IS LOCATED AT ITS END. THIS PROCESS IS REPEATED UNTIL ALL REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN SATISFIED. THE RESULTING PHENOTYPES ARE SETS OF TOURS WHICH, IN TURN, ARE SEQUENCES OF EDGES.

TO EFFICIENTLY PLAN WASTE COLLECTION, LARGE MUNICIPALITIES MAY BE PARTITIONED INTO CONVENIENT SECTORS AND ONLY THEN CAN ROUTING PROBLEMS BE SOLVED IN EACH SECTOR. THREE DIVERSE SITUATIONS ARE DESCRIBED, RESULTING IN THREE DIFFERENT NEW MODELS. IN THE FIRST SITUATION, THERE IS A SINGLE POINT OF WASTE DISPOSAL FROM WHERE THE VEHICLES DEPART AND TO WHERE THEY RETURN. THE VEHICLE FLEET COMPRISES THREE TYPES OF COLLECTION VEHICLES. IN THE SECOND, THE GARAGE DOES NOT MATCH ANY OF THE POINTS OF DISPOSAL. THE VEHICLE IS UNIQUE AND THE POINTS OF DISPOSAL (LANDFILLS OR TRANSFER STATIONS) MAY HAVE LIMITATIONS IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF VISITS PER DAY. IN THE THIRD SITUATION, DISPOSAL POINTS ARE MULTIPLE (THEY DO NOT COINCIDE WITH THE GARAGE), THEY ARE LIMITED IN THE NUMBER OF VISITS, AND THE FLEET IS COMPOSED OF TWO TYPES OF VEHICLES. COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS BASED NOT ONLY ON INSTANCES ADAPTED FROM THE LITERATURE BUT ALSO ON REAL CASES ARE PRESENTED AND ANALYZED.

FIVE COMMONLY USED ARC ROUTING MOVE OPERATORS WERE ADAPTED FOR THE PROBLEM, AND BASIC LOCAL SEARCH IMPLEMENTATIONS WERE TESTED ON WASTE COLLECTION BENCHMARK SETS. TESTS SHOWED THAT DESPITE THE APPLICATION OF COMMONLY USED SPEED-UP TECHNIQUES, THE LOCAL SEARCH IMPLEMENTATIONS ARE VERY SLOW ON LARGE TEST INSTANCES WITH MORE THAN ONE-THOUSAND REQUIRED ARCS AND EDGES. IN RESPONSE, MORE ADVANCED LOCAL SEARCH ACCELERATION MECHANISMS FROM LITERATURE WERE ADAPTED AND COMBINED FOR THE MCARPTIF AND TESTED ON THE SAME INSTANCES. ON THE LARGE INSTANCES, THE BASIC LOCAL SEARCH SETUPS TOOK BETWEEN 15 MIN AND 3 H TO IMPROVE A SINGLE SOLUTION TO LOCAL OPTIMA, WHEREAS THE ACCELERATED IMPLEMENTATIONS TOOK AT MOST 4 MIN WHILE PRODUCING SIMILAR QUALITY LOCAL OPTIMA. THE BEST PERFORMING IMPLEMENTATION MADE USE OF TWO EXISTING ACCELERATION MECHANISMS, NAMELY STATIC-MOVE-DESCRIPTORS AND GREEDY-COMPOUND-INDEPENDENT-MOVES. A THIRD MECHANISM, NEAREST NEIGHBOUR-LISTS WAS ALSO TESTED AND ALTHOUGH IT REDUCED EXECUTION TIMES IT RESULTED IN LOCAL SEARCH TERMINATING AT WORSE QUALITY LOCAL OPTIMA. GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL SEARCH WITHIN METAHEURISTICS, THE DEVELOPED LOCAL SEARCH HEURISTICS PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO ARC ROUTING. FIRST, THE IMPLEMENTATIONS CAN BE EXTENDED TO AND INCORPORATED INTO METAHEURISTICS FOR THE MCARPTIF. SECOND, THE ACCELERATION MECHANISMS CAN BE APPLIED TO EXISTING LOCAL SEARCH METAHEURISTICS FOR CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEMS, THEREBY IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE METAHEURISTICS AND ALLOWING THEM TO BETTER DEAL WITH LARGE INSTANCES.

THIS PAPER EVALUATES FOUR CONSTRUCTIVE HEURISTICS CAPABLE OF COMPUTING FEASIBLE SOLUTIONS FOR THE MCARPTIF WITH A PRIMARY OBJECTIVE TO EITHER MINIMISE TOTAL COST OR TO MINIMISE THE FLEET SIZE. THE HEURISTICS WERE ADAPTED FROM PATH-SCANNING AND IMPROVED-MERGE FOR THE MIXED CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM, AND COMPARED AGAINST TWO ROUTE-FIRST-CLUSTER-SECOND HEURISTICS FOR THE MCARPTIF. THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO IDENTIFY THE BEST PERFORMING HEURISTIC FOR APPLICATION PURPOSES. IN PRACTICE, THE CARP IS OFTEN SOLVED FOR REAL-TIME OR NEAR REAL-TIME DECISION SUPPORT. COMPUTATIONAL TIME REQUIRED BY THE HEURISTICS WAS THUS ALSO EVALUATED. IDENTIFYING THE BEST HEURISTIC PROVED DIFFICULT DUE TO A LACK OF REALISTIC MCARPTIF BENCHMARK SETS, WITH THE TWO CLARPIF SETS PREDOMINANTLY SOLVED IN THE LITERATURE NOT RESEMBLING ACTUAL WASTE COLLECTION INSTANCES. ROUTE-FIRST-CLUSTER-SECOND HEURISTICS, LINKED WITH A NEW VEHICLE REDUCTION HEURISTIC PERFORMED THE WORST ON THE TWO CLARPIF SETS, YET PERFORMED THE BEST ON NEW WASTE COLLECTION SETS TAKEN FROM THE LITERATURE AND INTRODUCED IN THIS PAPER. IMPROVED-MERGE PERFORMED THE BEST ON TWO EXISTING CLARPIF SETS AND ON A REALISTIC SET WITH INTERMEDIATE-FACILITIES INCIDENT WITH THE VEHICLE DEPOT, BUT STRUGGLED ON ALL OTHER SETS AND IN MINIMISING FLEET SIZE. PATH-SCANNING WAS THE MOST ROBUST HEURISTIC, PERFORMING REASONABLY WELL ON ALL BENCHMARK SETS AND BOTH OBJECTIVES. RESULTS FURTHER SHOW THAT DUE TO THE HIGH COMPUTATIONAL TIME OF ONE OF THE ROUTE-FIRST-CLUSTER-SECOND HEURISTICS, WHICH WAS ONLY EXPOSED ON REALISTICALLY SIZED SETS, THE SLIGHTLY WORSE VERSION IS THE BEST ALTERNATIVE WHEN REAL-TIME SUPPORT IS REQUIRED FOR WASTE COLLECTION APPLICATIONS.

VEHICLE SERVICE ROUTES WITH A LIMITED NUMBER OF INTERSECTIONS. THIS CONSTRAINT LEADS TO SOLUTIONS THAT ARE BETTER SHAPED FOR REAL APPLICATION PURPOSES.

THE BEST FEASIBLE UPPER BOUND IS OBTAINED FROM A MODIFIED MCARP IN WHICH THE MINIMIZATION CRITERIA IS GIVEN BY THE OVERLAPPING OF THE ROUTES.

"ZHANG Y, 2017, APPL SOFT COMPUT",MEMETIC ALGORITHM WITH ROUTE DECOMPOSING FOR PERIODIC CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM,"IN THIS PAPER,HE PERIODIC CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM (PCARP) IS INVESTIGATED. PCARP IS AN EXTENSIONOF THE WELL-KNOWN CARP FROM A SINGLE PERIOD TO A MULTI-PERIOD HORIZON. IN PCARP, TWO OBJECTIVES ARE TOBE MINIMIZED. ONE IS THE NUMBER OF REQUIRED VEHICLES (NV), AND THE OTHER IS THE TOTAL COST (TC). DUE TO THE MULTI-PERIOD NATURE, GIVEN THE SAME GRAPH OR ROAD NETWORK, PCARP CAN HAVE A MUCH LARGER SOLUTION SPACE THAN THE SINGLE-PERIOD CARP COUNTERPART. FURTHERMORE, PCARP CONSISTS OF AN ADDITIONAL ALLOCATION SUB-PROBLEM (OF THE DAYS TO SERVE THE ARCS), WHICH IS INTERDEPENDENT WITH THE ROUTING SUB-PROBLEM. ALTHOUGH SOME ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR SOLVING PCARP, MORE INVESTIGATIONS ARE YET TO BE DONE TO FURTHER IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE ESPECIALLY ON LARGE-SCALE PROBLEM INSTANCES. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT OPTIMIZING NV AND TC SEPARATELY (HIERARCHICALLY) IS A GOOD WAY OF DEALING WITH THE TWO OBJECTIVES. IN THIS PAPER, WE FURTHER IMPROVE THIS STRATEGY AND PROPOSE A NEW ROUTE DECOMPOSITION (RD) OPERATORTHEREBY. THEN, THE RD OPERATOR IS INTEGRATED INTO A MEMETIC ALGORITHM (MA) FRAMEWORK FOR PCARP, IN WHICH NOVEL CROSSOVER AND LOCAL SEARCH OPERATORS ARE DESIGNED ACCORDINGLY. IN ADDITION, TO IMPROVE THE SEARCH EFFICIENCY, A HYBRIDIZED INITIALIZATION IS EMPLOYED TO GENERATE AN INITIAL POPULATION CONSISTING OF BOTH HEURISTIC AND RANDOM INDIVIDUALS. THE MA WITH RD (MARD) WAS EVALUATED AND COMPARED WITHTHE STATE-OF-THE-ART APPROACHES ON TWO BENCHMARK SETS OF PCARP INSTANCES AND A LARGE DATA SET WHICH IS BASED ON A REAL-WORLD ROAD NETWORK. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SUGGEST THAT MARD OUTPERFORMS THE COMPARED STATE-OF-THE-ART ALGORITHMS, AND IMPROVES MOST OF THE BEST-KNOWN SOLUTIONS. THE ADVANTAGE OF MARD BECOMES MORE OBVIOUS WHEN THE PROBLEM SIZE INCREASES. THUS, MARD IS PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN SOLVING LARGE-SCALE PCARP INSTANCES.

THE SECOND PHASE ADDRESSES THE ROUTING PROBLEMS IN EACH SECTOR. THE PAPER ADDRESSES NOT ONLY TERRITORIAL DIVISION, BUT ALSO THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH WASTE IS COLLECTED, WHICH IS A CRITICAL ISSUE IN THESE TYPES OF APPLICATIONS. SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS RELATED TO THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF DEPOSITION POINTS WERE ALSO A MOTIVATION FOR THIS WORK. A NEW MODEL FOR A MIXED CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM WITH LIMITED MULTI-LANDFILLS IS PROPOSED AND TESTED IN REAL INSTANCES.

BASED ON A WASTE COLLECTION PROJECT, WE INTRODUCE A NUMBER OF NEW CARP VARIATIONS. WE FIRST PRESENT THREE MULTI-COMPARTMENT CARP VARIATIONS OF DIFFERENT LEVELS OF COMPLEXITY REGARDING COMPARTMENTS AND WHERE ONE INCORPORATES A TIME HORIZON. WE THEN PRESENT A VARIATION THAT SEEKS TO COORDINATE VEHICLES OVER A PLANNING HORIZON SUCH THAT THE VEHICLES THAT COLLECT DIFFERENT WASTE FRACTIONS FROM THE SAME HOUSEHOLDS DO SO ON THE SAME DAY OF THE WEEK. FINALLY, THE SEMI-PERIODIC CARP TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE HOUSEHOLDS ON A STREET, PROVIDING THE DEMAND OF THE EDGE, MAY NOT REQUEST WASTE COLLECTION AT THE SAME INTERVAL. WE PRESENT LARGE-SCALE INSTANCES BOTH FOR THE CLASSICAL CARP AND FOR THE FIVE NEW PROBLEMS. THE INSTANCES ARE BASED ON REAL-LIFE NETWORKS AND WASTE DATA FROM FIVE AREAS IN DENMARK AND COVER RURAL AS WELL AS URBAN AREAS. THE LARGEST INSTANCES CONTAIN MORE THAN 10,000 NODES.

THIS METHOD IS DEVELOPED IN THE CONTEXT OF MONOTROPIC PROGRAMMING THEORY AND BASES A PROMISING FOUNDATION FOR DEVELOPING SPECIALIZED ALGORITHMS IN ORDER TO SOLVE GENERAL INTEGER PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS. IN PARTICULAR, THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM GENERALIZES THE RELAXATION ALGORITHM DEVELOPED BY TSENG AND BERTSEKAS (MATH. OPER. RES. 12(4):569-596, 1987) FOR SOLVING LINEAR PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS. THIS METHOD CAN ALSO BE VIEWED AS AN ALTERNATIVE FOR THE SUBGRADIENT METHOD FOR SOLVING LAGRANGIAN RELAXED PROBLEMS.

THE SPLIT-DELIVERY CAPACITATED ARC-ROUTING PROBLEM (SDCARP) GENERALIZES CONVENTIONAL ARPS BY ALLOWING AN ARC TO BE SERVICED BY MORE THAN ONE VEHICLE. BECAUSE OF ITS GREAT COMPLEXITY, THE EXISTING APPROACHES FOR SOLVING SDCARP ARE SCANT AND MOST OF THEM ARE META-HEURISTICS. IN THIS PAPER, WE ANALYZE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SDCARP SOLUTION STRUCTURES. THEN WE DEVISE A FOREST-BASED TABU SEARCH ALGORITHM, WHICH INVOLVES SEVERAL FOREST-BASED NEIGHBORHOOD OPERATORS, FOR SEEKING THE OPTIMAL SOLUTION.

THE TCARP IS A REALISTIC EXTENSION OF THE CAPACITATED ARC ROUTING PROBLEM IN WHICH EDGE-SERVICING AND EDGE-TRAVERSING COSTS, AS WELL AS VEHICLE CAPACITIES, ARE ALL TIME-BASEDI.E., GIVEN IN TIME UNITS. ACCORDINGLY, THE TCARP GOAL IS TO MINIMISE THE TOTAL TIME EMPLOYED IN SERVICING THE REQUIRED EDGES, FOR WHICH OTHER EDGES MIGHT NEED TO BE TRAVERSED TOO. ACCORDING TO THE NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS CARRIED OUT, THE PROPOSED HEURISTIC IS ABLE TO PROVIDE REAL-TIME RESULTS OF HIGH QUALITY EVEN FOR THE LARGEST INSTANCES CONSIDERED.

BEING A DETERMINISTIC MODEL, IT IS FAR AWAY FROM THE REAL WORLD. A MORE PRACTICAL PROBLEM MODEL OF CARP IS THE UNCERTAIN CARP (UCARP), WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF FINDING A ROBUST SOLUTION WHICH PERFORMS WELL IN ALL POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTS. THERE EXIST FEW ALGORITHMS FOR UCARP IN PREVIOUS WORK. IN THIS PAPER, A MEMETIC ALGORITHM (MA) AND ITS MODIFIED VERSION IN TIME CONSUMPTION FOR UCARP ARE PROPOSED. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ON TWO BENCHMARK TEST SETS SHOW THAT WITH AN INTEGRATED FITNESS FUNCTION AND A LARGE STEP-SIZE LOCAL SEARCH OPERATOR, THE NEW MAS SHOW EXCELLENT ABILITY TO FIND ROBUST SOLUTIONS FOR UCARP.

WE SUBSEQUENTLY PROPOSE A HYBRID ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION (ACO) ALGORITHM (HACOA) TO SOLVE INSTANCES OF THE EXTENDED CARP. THIS APPROACH IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE EXPLOITATION OF HEURISTIC INFORMATION, ADAPTIVE PARAMETERS, AND LOCAL OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES: TWO KINDS OF HEURISTIC INFORMATION, ARC CLUSTER INFORMATION AND ARC PRIORITY INFORMATION, ARE OBTAINED CONTINUOUSLY FROM THE SOLUTIONS SAMPLED TO GUIDE THE SUBSEQUENT OPTIMIZATION PROCESS. THE ADAPTIVE PARAMETERS EASE THE BURDEN OF CHOOSING INITIAL VALUES AND FACILITATE IMPROVED AND MORE ROBUST RESULTS. FINALLY, LOCAL OPTIMIZATION, BASED ON THE TWO-OPT HEURISTIC, IS EMPLOYED TO IMPROVE THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM. THE RESULTING HACOA IS TESTED ON FOUR SETS OF BENCHMARK PROBLEMS CONTAINING A TOTAL OF 87 INSTANCES WITH UP TO 140 NODES AND 380 ARCS.
