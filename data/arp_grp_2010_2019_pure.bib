Abstract = {{In this paper, we deal with an extension of the rural postman problem in
   which some links of a mixed graph must be traversed a given number of
   times over a time horizon. These links represent entities that must be
   serviced a specified number of times in some subsets of days (or
   periods) of the time horizon. The aim is to design a set of minimum-cost
   tours, one for each day/period of the time horizon, that satisfy the
   service requirements. We refer to this problem as the periodic rural
   postman problem with irregular services (PRPP-IS). Some practical
   applications of the problem can be found in road maintenance operations
   and road network surveillance, for example. In order to solve the
   PRPP-IS, we propose a mathematical model and a branch-and-cut algorithm.
   As far as we know, this is the first exact method devised for a periodic
   arc routing problem. In the solution framework, constraints ensuring
   connectivity and other valid inequalities are identified by using
   specific separation procedures. Most valid inequalities consider the
   particular nature of the PRPP-IS. We show the effectiveness of the
   solution approach through an extensive experimental phase. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{In this paper, we extend our previous work on greedy constructive
   heuristics for the Mixed Capacitated Arc Routing Problem under Time
   Restrictions with Intermediate Facilities (MCARPTIF) by developing
   efficient local search improvement heuristics for the problem. Five
   commonly used arc routing move operators were adapted for the problem,
   and basic local search implementations were tested on waste collection
   benchmark sets. Tests showed that despite the application of commonly
   used speed-up techniques, the local search implementations are very slow
   on large test instances with more than one-thousand required arcs and
   edges. In response, more advanced local search acceleration mechanisms
   from literature were adapted and combined for the MCARPTIF and tested on
   the same instances. On the large instances, the basic local search
   setups took between 15 min and 3 h to improve a single solution to local
   optima, whereas the accelerated implementations took at most 4 min while
   producing similar quality local optima. The best performing
   implementation made use of two existing acceleration mechanisms, namely
   Static-Move-Descriptors and Greedy-Compound-Independent-Moves. A third
   mechanism, Nearest Neighbour-Lists was also tested and although it
   reduced execution times it resulted in local search terminating at worse
   quality local optima. Given the importance of local search within
   metaheuristics, the developed local search heuristics provide a
   significant contribution to arc routing. First, the implementations can
   be extended to and incorporated into metaheuristics for the MCARPTIF.
   Second, the acceleration mechanisms can be applied to existing local
   search metaheuristics for Capacitated Arc Routing Problems, thereby
   improving the efficiency of the metaheuristics and allowing them to
   better deal with large instances. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the Directed Rural Postman Problem with Turn

   arcs of the graph. The total cost of the tour is the sum of the lengths
   of the traversed arcs plus the penalties associated with the turns. One
   solution approach involves transforming the arc routing problem into an
   equivalent node routing problem. An alternative direct approach (without
   graph transformation) that involves two stages has been proposed in the
   literature. In the first part of this paper, we investigate the
   applicability of the direct approach. We identify several
   characteristics of the input instance that make this approach effective
   and present several limitations of this approach. In the second part of
   this paper, we describe an integer linear program that is combined with
   a local search algorithm. This combination produces high-quality
   solutions to the DRPP-TP in a reasonable amount of computing time. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper we develop several approaches to approximately solve the

   present a brief survey about a transformation technique to transform the
   sparse CARP into a sparse capacitated vehicle routing problem namely
   sparse CVRP. Later, we propose several approaches to solve the sparse

   is a constructive heuristic (CH) used to construct an initial feasible
   solution. The second approach is an improving randomized procedure (IRP)
   used to improve the quality of the initial solution. Finally, we
   introduce the main adapted tabu search approach (TS) under a sparse

   CH and IRP and attempts to compute a better solution for the sparse

Abstract = {{Municipal solid waste collection is an increasingly difficult task and
   has the highest operation cost in the solid waste management process;
   thus, finding the optimal routes for the waste collection is a most
   tactically significant decision that should be focused on due to the
   population growth. This research investigated the multi-compartment
   capacitated arc routing problem with intermediate facilities (MCCARPIF)
   in the context of solid waste collection. This problem has been
   researched rarely in the past in the real world. The MCCARPIF develops
   the capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) by considering both the
   multi-compartment vehicles and intermediate facilities together. In case
   of waste separation, the fleet of vehicles should have multiple parts to
   avoid mixing waste together. In developing countries, the process of
   separating the wastes is not carried out comprehensively, so this
   subject is almost new and research about it can improve their waste
   collection process. Due to the complexity of this model, two algorithms
   are developed to solve it: an adaptive large neighborhood search
   algorithm (ALNS) and the hybrid ALNS with whale optimization algorithm.
   Results showed that hybrid ALNS with whale optimization algorithm got
   higher quality solutions in comparison to ALNS. A real case study in one
   of the districts of Tehran municipality has been considered and the
   results obtained show that the use of multi-compartment vehicles is more
   cost-effective than the use of single-compartment vehicles, reducing the
   total distance traveled.}},

Abstract = {{A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a stochastic search method that has been
   applied successfully for solving a variety of engineering optimization
   problems which are otherwise difficult to solve using classical,
   deterministic techniques. GAs are easier to implement as compared to
   many classical methods, and have thus attracted extensive attention over
   the last few decades. However, the inherent randomness of these
   algorithms often hinders convergence to the exact global optimum. In
   order to enhance their search capability, learning via memetics can be
   incorporated as an extra step in the genetic search procedure. This idea
   has been investigated in the literature, showing significant performance
   improvement. In this chapter, two research works that incorporate memes
   in distinctly different representations, are presented. In particular,
   the first work considers meme as a local search process, or an
   individual learning procedure, the intensity of which is governed by a
   theoretically derived upper bound. The second work treats meme as a
   building-block of structured knowledge, one that can be learned and
   transferred across problem instances for efficient and effective search.
   In order to showcase the enhancements achieved by incorporating learning
   via memetics into genetic search, case studies on solving the NP-hard
   capacitated arc routing problem are presented. Moreover, the application
   of the second meme representation concept to the emerging field of
   evolutionary bilevel optimization is briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) is a classical NP-Hard
   combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper, we present a memetic
   algorithm based on Extension step and Statistical filtering for
   Large-Scale CARP (ESMAENS) which has improvements in both the global
   search strategy and the local search strategy. Firstly, ESMAENS adopts
   the Route Distance Grouping decomposition scheme (RDG) to decompose the
   large-scale CARP into some independent sub-problems. Then, the initial
   population would evolve into a new group by using the Evolutionary
   Algorithm. Furthermore, ESMAENS introduces the extension step search
   strategy to search the potential solutions around the current solution.
   As a result, with the increase of the iteration number, it avoids
   getting to the premature convergence. Meanwhile, the diversity of the
   population can be increased. Finally, in the local search strategy, the
   statistical filter is used to filter out some solutions and make the
   algorithm get the lower bound at a faster convergence rate with a high
   stability. Compared with RDG-MAENS, experimental results on Beullen'C,
   D, E, F, egl and EGL-G test set show that ESMAENS has a better
   convergence rate, and the stability of solutions obtained is improved.
   Furthermore, ESMAENS achieves a global search for the solutions.
   Especially for the large-scale EGL-G test set, ESMAENS can converge to a
   lower bound at a faster convergence rate, and it is suitable for solving

   the cost of generation and emission of greenhouse gases, the cost of

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an approach to Large-Scale CARP called
   Quantum-Inspired Immune Clonal Algorithm (QICA-CARP). This algorithm
   combines the feature of artificial immune system and quantum computation
   ground on the qubit and the quantum superposition. We call an antibody
   of population quantum bit encoding, in QICA-CARP. For this encoding, to
   control the population with a high probability evolution towards a good
   schema we use the information on the current optimal antibody. The
   mutation strategy of quantum rotation gate accelerates the convergence
   of the original clone operator. Moreover, quantum crossover operator
   enhances the exchange of information and increases the diversity of the
   population. Furthermore, it avoids falling into local optimum. We also
   use the repair operator to amend the infeasible solutions to ensure the
   diversity of solutions. This makes QICA-CARP approximating the optimal
   solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by a set of
   experiments and by Comparing the results of our approach with ones
   obtained with the RDG-MAENS and RAM using different test sets.
   Experimental results show that QICA-CARP outperforms other algorithms in
   terms of convergence rate and the quality of the obtained solutions.
   Especially, QICA-CARP converges to a better lower bound at a faster rate
   illustrating that it is suitable for solving large-scale CARP.}},

   creates a giant tour, partitions the graph into districts, and construct
   routes within each district. It then iteratively merges and splits
   adjacent districts and reoptimises the routes. The heuristic was tested
   on 264 benchmark instances containing up to 11,640 nodes, 12,675 edges,
   8581 required edges, and 323 vehicles. FASTCARP was compared with an
   alternative heuristic called BASE and with several Path-Scanning

   larger graphs, it was much faster and only slightly worse than BASE in
   terms of solution quality. It also outperforms the Path-Scanning

   routing problem with intermediate refill facilities (SWRPIR), a variant
   of the capacitated arc routing problem. Routes for street washing trucks
   are normally planned in advance and must be designed to take into
   account the vehicle capacity. Street washing vehicles could refill water
   at intermediate refill points without going back to the depot to save

Abstract = {{Residential waste collection is an expensive but essential service.
   Since such a large portion of the cost associated with residential waste
   collection is attributable to transportation it has become the focus of
   numerous studies on vehicle routing and optimisation. While vehicle
   routing models have great potential for reducing waste collection costs,
   a key challenge remains the input data used in these models. Literature
   focuses predominantly on problem formulation and solution methods as
   opposed to developing methods to estimate input parameters. Big data,
   and in particular GPS devices fitted on waste collection vehicles, offer
   a great opportunity to address this shortcoming. This is demonstrated,
   in this paper, by analysing GPS records of waste collection vehicles in
   and around a waste transfer station. Through the analysis we show that
   the duration of waste dropoffs follow a power-law distribution, whereas
   vehicle routing models treat it as deterministic. The fitted
   distribution can be used in future studies to evaluate the operational
   impact of stochastic drop-off times on routes developed using
   traditional routing models. We further analyse whether congestion in the
   transfer station results in an increase in drop-off duration and found
   that it does not have a major impact.}},

Abstract = {{The capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) captures important aspects of
   real-life problems and has been studied extensively over the past two
   decades. Based on a waste collection project, we introduce a number of
   new CARP variations. We first present three multi-compartment CARP
   variations of different levels of complexity regarding compartments and
   where one incorporates a time horizon. We then present a variation that
   seeks to coordinate vehicles over a planning horizon such that the
   vehicles that collect different waste fractions from the same households
   do so on the same day of the week. Finally, the semi-periodic CARP takes
   into account that the households on a street, providing the demand of
   the edge, may not request waste collection at the same interval. We
   present large-scale instances both for the classical CARP and for the
   five new problems. The instances are based on real-life networks and
   waste data from five areas in Denmark and cover rural as well as urban
   areas. The largest instances contain more than 10,000 nodes. We give

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a simheuristic algorithm for solving the Arc Routing

   biased-randomised version of a savings-based heuristic for the CARP,

   with the stochastic variant of the problem in a natural and efficient

   delivery stage to satisfy unexpected demands. A reliability index is
   also defined to evaluate the robustness of each solution with respect to
   possible route failures caused by random demands. Some numerical

Abstract = {{The periodic capacitated arc routing problem (PCARP) is a challenging
   general model with important applications. The PCARP has two
   hierarchical optimization objectives: a primary objective of minimizing
   the number of vehicles (F-v) and a secondary objective of minimizing the
   total cost (Fe). In this paper, we propose an effective two phased
   hybrid local search (HLS) algorithm for the PCARP. The first phase makes
   a particular effort to optimize the primary objective while the second
   phase seeks to further optimize both objectives by using the resulting
   number of vehicles of the first phase as an upper bound to prune the
   search space. For both phases, combined local search heuristics are
   devised to ensure an effective exploration of the search space.
   Experimental results on 63 benchmark instances demonstrate that HLS
   performs remarkably well both in terms of computational efficiency and
   solution quality. In particular, HLS discovers 44 improved best known
   values (new upper bounds) for the total cost objective Pc while
   attaining all the known optimal values regarding the objective of the
   number of vehicles F-v. To our knowledge, this is the first PCARP
   algorithm reaching such a performance. Key components of HLS are

Abstract = {{The capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) is a challenging optimization
   problem with lots of applications in the real world. Numerous approaches
   have been proposed to tackle this problem. Most of these methods, albeit
   showing good performance on CARP instances of small and median sizes, do
   not scale well to large-scale CARPs, e.g., taking at least a few hours
   to achieve a satisfactory solution on a CARP instance with thousands of
   tasks. In this paper, an efficient and scalable approach is proposed for
   CARPs. The key idea of the proposed approach is to hierarchically
   decompose the tasks involved in a CARP instance into subgroups and solve
   the induced subproblems recursively. The output of the subproblems at
   the lower layer in the hierarchy is treated as virtual tasks and new
   subproblems are formulated based on these virtual tasks using clustering
   techniques. By this means, the number of tasks (or virtual tasks)
   decreases rapidly from the bottom to the top layers of the hierarchy,
   and the sizes of all subproblems at each layer can be kept tractable
   even for very large-scale CARPs. Empirical studies are conducted on CARP
   instances with up to 3584 tasks, which are an order of magnitude larger
   than the number of tasks involved in all CARP instances investigated in
   the literature. The results show that the proposed approach
   significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of scalability.
   Since the proposed hierarchical decomposition scheme is designed to
   obtain a good permutation of tasks in a CARP instance, it may also be
   generalized to other hard optimization problems that can be formulated
   as permutation-based optimization problems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we introduce and study the Undirected Capacitated General
   Routing Problem with Profits (UC-GRPP). This problem is defined on an
   undirected graph where a subset of vertices and edges correspond to
   customers, which are associated with a given profit and demand. The
   profit of each customer can be collected at most once. A fleet of
   homogeneous capacitated vehicles is given to serve the customers. The
   objective is to find the vehicle routes that maximize the difference
   between the total collected profit and the traveling cost in such a way
   that the demand collected by each vehicle does not exceed the capacity
   and the total duration of each route is not greater than a maximum given
   time limit. We propose a mathematical formulation of the problem and
   introduce valid inequalities to strengthen the corresponding continuous
   relaxation. Moreover, we provide an aggregate formulation that allows us
   to introduce further inequalities. Then, we propose a two-phase exact
   algorithm for the solution of the UCGRPP. In the first phase, a
   branch-and-cut algorithm is used to solve the aggregate formulation and
   to identify a cut pool of aggregate valid inequalities to be used in the
   second phase, where a branch-and-cut algorithm is implemented to
   optimally solve the UCGRPP. Computational results on a large set of
   problem instances show that the use of the aggregate formulation is
   effective, making the two-phase exact algorithm able to optimally solve
   a large number of instances. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper,he Periodic Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (PCARP) is
   investigated. PCARP is an extensionof the well-known CARP from a single
   period to a multi-period horizon. In PCARP, two objectives are tobe
   minimized. One is the number of required vehicles (nv), and the other is
   the total cost (tc). Due to the multi-period nature, given the same
   graph or road network, PCARP can have a much larger solution space than
   the single-period CARP counterpart. Furthermore, PCARP consists of an
   additional allocation sub-problem (of the days to serve the arcs), which
   is interdependent with the routing sub-problem. Although some attempts
   have been made for solving PCARP, more investigations are yet to be done
   to further improve their performance especially on large-scale problem
   instances. It has been shown that optimizing nv and tc separately
   (hierarchically) is a good way of dealing with the two objectives. In
   this paper, we further improve this strategy and propose a new Route
   Decomposition (RD) operatorthereby. Then, the RD operator is integrated
   into a Memetic Algorithm (MA) framework for PCARP, in which novel
   crossover and local search operators are designed accordingly. In
   addition, to improve the search efficiency, a hybridized initialization
   is employed to generate an initial population consisting of both
   heuristic and random individuals. The MA with RD (MARD) was evaluated
   and compared withthe state-of-the-art approaches on two benchmark sets
   of PCARP instances and a large data set which is based on a real-world
   road network. The experimental results suggest that MARD outperforms the
   compared state-of-the-art algorithms, and improves most of the
   best-known solutions. The advantage of MARD becomes more obvious when
   the problem size increases. Thus, MARD is particularly effective in
   solving large-scale PCARP instances. Moreover, the efficacy of the
   proposed RD operator in MARD has been empirically verified. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{We propose a method that combines Column Generation (CG) and Iterated
   Local Search (ILS) to solve the Capacitated Arc -Routing Problem (CARP).
   One of the goals is to integrate into the ILS (some of) the duality
   information that underpins the CG paradigm. The CARP is expressed in a
   space of permutations and sub-permutations (sequences, routes) of the
   set of required edges. For this, the ILS uses an exact decoder that maps
   any permutation s to a list of sequences (routes) of minimum cost
   servicing all edges in the order s(1), s(2), s(3), etc. This permutation
   space is explored both by an ILS process and a CG process that run in
   parallel and that communicate by exchanging sequences. The first use of
   the CG paradigm in ILS is the following: all sequences discovered by CG
   are sent to the ILS process that can inject them into the current ILS
   solution. The second application of CG in ILS is a ``CG improver{''}
   operator that acts on the current ILS solution, so as to (try to)
   improve it by running several CG iterations. The first half of the paper
   describes the method in a general framework based on sequences,
   permutations and set covering. The second part is devoted to more
   specialized Arc -Routing techniques. For instance, the CG convergence
   could be accelerated by factors of tens or even hundreds by exploiting
   two ideas in the Dynamic Programming (DP) pricing: (i) avoid as much as
   possible to traverse edges without service, and (ii) record only
   non-dominated DP states using a fast-access data structure mixing an
   array and a red-black tree. Regarding the ILS, we show that the
   permutation-level search can be substantially improved if the exact
   decoder is reinforced by a deterministic post-decoder acting on explicit
   routes. The general results are competitive (reducing the best-known gap
   of five instances) and certain ideas could be potentially useful for
   other set-covering or permutation problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Wireless energy transfer has provided a promising technology to extend
   the lifetime of wireless rechargeable sensor network. Most of previous
   studies focus on scheduling chargers or deploying stationary charging
   stations to replenish energy for rechargeable sensors. These methods
   could not be applicable when real deployment is concerned, because the
   roadway needs to be fully respected for mobile chargers in typical urban
   area. In dealing with this difficulty, we investigate the problem of
   scheduling mobile chargers with mobility constraints in the scenario of
   a city graph. First of all, we aim at optimizing the traveling path for
   chargers to minimize the traveling cost. Consequently, we convert our
   scheduling problem into edge coverage problem, which is quite different
   from the point coverage problem. Then classical problem CARP
   (Capacitated Arc Routing Problem), which has been proved NP-hard, is
   applied to solve aforementioned problem. To this end, a simple but
   efficient genetic algorithm cooperated with decoding algorithm Split is
   proposed. Finally, we evaluate the impacts of different parameters on
   our algorithm and get the near optimal solution.}},

Abstract = {{The capacitated arc routing problem is playing an increasingly important
   role in our society, engendering increasing attention from the research
   community. Among the various models, multi-objective capacitated arc
   routing problem comes much closer to real-world problems. Therefore,
   this paper proposes an immune clonal algorithm based on directed
   evolution to solve this problem. Firstly, the proposed algorithm adopts
   the framework of the immune clonal algorithm and expands the scale of
   the initial antibody population in the initialization process to
   increase the diversity of the antibodies. Secondly, the proposed
   algorithm is combined with a decomposition strategy in the operations of
   the immune gene. Antibodies are classified to perform the immune genetic
   operations, which helps the antibody populations to share the
   neighborhood information in a timely manner. Thirdly, the proposed
   algorithm applies a novel kind of comparison operator to build the total
   population, which helps it to evolve in the direction of a better
   population and improves the quality of the antibodies. Experimental
   results suggest that the proposed algorithm can generate better
   non-dominant solutions than several compared state-of-the-art

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of residential waste collection, as a
   real life application of a sectoring-arc routing problem (SARP).
   Tactical decisions comprise the partition of the service territory into
   a number of sectors so that each sector can be covered by a set of
   vehicle trips. In addition, operational decisions involving the design
   of the vehicle trips that minimize total routing time are to be made.
   Apart from supporting good vehicle trips, sectors should also be planned
   such that the workload time imbalance as well as the number of connected
   components are minimized. These later try to promote service areas
   (sectors) geographically concentrated and grouped into delimited
   regions. We propose two local search methods: a hill climbing and a tabu
   search based heuristic. A constructive heuristic for obtaining an
   initial solution is also suggested. By means of a normalized weighted
   sum of criteria for evaluating solutions, the local search heuristics
   were tailored to improve the features of the initial solution. The
   algorithms are tested on random instances and also on real life based
   instances. The results show that the proposed local search methods are
   an efficient way of obtaining good quality solutions to implement in
   practice. Results also highlight that the proposed function for
   evaluating solutions during the search phase plays an essential role.

   a fleet of capacitated vehicles has to serve a set of requests by
   traversing a mixed weighted graph. The requests may be located on nodes,
   edges, and arcs. The problem has theoretical interest because it is a
   generalization of the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), the
   capacitated arc routing problem (CARP), and the general routing problem.
   It is also of great practical interest since it is often a more accurate
   model for real-world cases than its widely studied specializations,
   particularly for so-called street routing applications. Examples are
   urban waste collection, snow removal, and newspaper delivery. We propose
   a new iterated local search metaheuristic for the problem that also
   includes vital mechanisms from adaptive large neighborhood search
   combined with further intensification through local search. The method
   utilizes selected, tailored, and novel local search and large
   neighborhood search operators, as well as a new local search strategy.
   Computational experiments show that the proposed metaheuristic is highly
   effective on five published benchmarks for the MCGRP. The metaheuristic

Abstract = {{The capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) is a difficult combinatorial
   optimization problem that has been intensively studied in the last
   decades. We present a hybrid metaheuristic approach (HMA) to solve this
   problem which incorporates an effective local refinement procedure,
   coupling a randomized tabu thresholding procedure with an infeasible
   descent procedure, into the memetic framework. Other distinguishing
   features of HMA include a specially designed route-based crossover
   operator for solution recombination and a distance-and-quality based
   replacement criterion for pool updating. Extensive experimental studies
   show that HMA is highly scalable and is able to quickly identify either
   the best known results or improved best known results for almost all
   currently available CARP benchmark instances. In particular, it
   discovers an improved best known result for 15 benchmark instances (6
   classical instances and 9 large-sized instances whose optima are
   unknown). Furthermore, we analyze some key elements and properties of
   the HMA-CARP algorithm to better understand its behavior. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Ejection chain methods, which include the classical Lin-Kernighan (LK)
   procedure and the Stem-and-Cycle (S\&C) reference structure, have been
   the source of the currently leading algorithms for large scale symmetric
   traveling salesman problems (STSP). Although these methods proved highly
   effective in generating large neighborhoods for symmetric instances,
   their potential application to the asymmetric setting of the problem
   (ATSP) introduces new challenges that require special consideration.
   This article extends our studies on the single-rootedS\& Cto examine the
   more advanced doubly-rooted (DR) reference structure. The DR structure,
   which is allied both to metaheuristics and network optimization, allows
   more complex network-related (alternating) paths to transition from one
   tour to another, and offers special advantages for the ATSP.
   Computational experiments on an extensive testbed exhibits superior
   performance for the DR neighborhood over its LK counterpart for the
   ATSP. We additionally show that a straightforward implementation of a DR
   ejection chain algorithm outperforms the best local search algorithms
   and obtains solutions comparable to those obtained by the currently most
   advanced special-purpose algorithms for the ATSP, while requiring
   dramatically reduced computation time. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In the mixed capacitated general routing problem, one seeks to determine
   a minimum cost set of vehicle routes serving segments of a mixed network
   consisting of nodes, edges, and arcs. We study a bi-objective variant of
   the problem, in which, in addition to seeking a set of routes of low
   cost, one simultaneously seeks a set of routes in which the work load is
   balanced. Due to the conflict between the objectives, finding a solution
   that simultaneously optimizes both objectives is usually impossible.
   Thus, we seek to generate many or all efficient, or Pareto-optimal,
   solutions, i.e., solutions in which it is impossible to improve the
   value of one objective without deterioration in the value of the other
   objective. Route balance can be modeled in different ways, and a
   computational study using small benchmark instances of the mixed
   capacitated general routing problem demonstrates that the choice of
   route balance modeling has a significant impact on the number and
   diversity of Pareto-optimal solutions. The results of the computational
   study suggest that modeling route balance in terms of the difference
   between the longest and shortest route in a solution is a robust choice
   that performs well across a variety of instances. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{In existing metaheuristics for solving the capacitated arc routing
   problem, traversal local search operators are often used to explore
   neighbors of the current solutions. This mechanism is beneficial for
   finding high-quality solutions; however, it entails a large number of
   function evaluations, causing high computational complexity. Hence,
   there is a need to further enhance the efficiency of such algorithms.
   This paper proposes a high-efficiency immune clonal selection algorithm
   for capacitated arc routing instances within a limited number of
   function evaluations. First, an improved constructive heuristic is used
   to initialize the antibody population. The initial antibodies generated
   by this heuristic help accelerate the algorithm's convergence. Second,
   we show how an immune clonal selection algorithm can select in favor of
   these high-quality antibodies. By adopting a variety of different
   strategies for different clones of the same antibody, it not only
   promotes cooperation and information exchanging among antibodies, but
   also increases diversity and speeds up convergence. Third, two different
   antibody repair operations are proposed for repairing various kinds of
   infeasible solutions. These operations cause infeasible solutions to
   move towards global optima. Experimental studies demonstrate improved
   performance over state-of-art algorithms, especially on medium-scale

Abstract = {{The capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) has attracted considerable
   attention from researchers due to its broad potential for social
   applications. This paper builds on, and develops beyond, the cooperative
   coevolutionary algorithm based on route distance grouping (RDG-MAENS),
   recently proposed by Mei et al. Although Mei's method has proved
   superior to previous algorithms, we discuss several remaining drawbacks
   and propose solutions to overcome them. First, although RDG is used in
   searching for potential better solutions, the solution generated from
   the decomposed problem at each generation is not the best one, and the
   best solution found so far is not used for solving the current
   generation. Second, to determine which sub-population the individual
   belongs to simply according to the distance can lead to an imbalance in
   the number of the individuals among different sub-populations and the
   allocation of resources. Third, the method of Mei et al. was only used
   to solve single-objective CARP. To overcome the above issues, this paper
   proposes improving RDG-MAENS by updating the solutions immediately and
   applying them to solve the current solution through areas shared, and
   then according to the magnitude of the vector of the route direction,
   and a fast and simple allocation scheme is proposed to determine which
   decomposed problem the route belongs to. Finally, we combine the
   improved algorithm with an improved decomposition-based memetic
   algorithm to solve the multiobjective large scale CARP (LSCARP).
   Experimental results suggest that the proposed improved algorithm can
   achieve better results on both single-objective LSCARP and
   multiobjective LSCARP.}},

Abstract = {{The Mixed Capacity Arc Routing Problem under Time Restrictions with
   Intermediate Facilities (MCARPTIF) is an extension of the Arc Routing
   Problem under Capacity and Length Restrictions with Intermediate
   Facilities (CLARPIF) with application in municipal waste collection.
   This paper evaluates four constructive heuristics capable of computing
   feasible solutions for the MCARPTIF with a primary objective to either
   minimise total cost or to minimise the fleet size. The heuristics were
   adapted from Path-Scanning and Improved-Merge for the Mixed Capacitated
   Arc Routing Problem, and compared against two Route-First-Cluster-Second
   heuristics for the MCARPTIF. The objective was to identify the best
   performing heuristic for application purposes. In practice, the CARP is
   often solved for real-time or near real-time decision support.
   Computational time required by the heuristics was thus also evaluated.
   Identifying the best heuristic proved difficult due to a lack of
   realistic MCARPTIF benchmark sets, with the two CLARPIF sets
   predominantly solved in the literature not resembling actual waste
   collection instances. Route-First-Cluster-Second heuristics, linked with
   a new vehicle reduction heuristic performed the worst on the two CLARPIF
   sets, yet performed the best on new waste collection sets taken from the
   literature and introduced in this paper. Improved-Merge performed the
   best on two existing CLARPIF sets and on a realistic set with
   Intermediate-Facilities incident with the vehicle depot, but struggled
   on all other sets and in minimising fleet size. Path-Scanning was the
   most robust heuristic, performing reasonably well on all benchmark sets
   and both objectives. Results further show that due to the high
   computational time of one of the Route-First-Cluster-Second heuristics,
   which was only exposed on realistically sized sets, the slightly worse
   version is the best alternative when real-time support is required for
   waste collection applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Memetic algorithms (MAs), which have materialized as a fusion of
   population based global search and individual lifetime learning (i.e.,
   local search) in the literature, have been widely used in real world
   applications to solve complex optimization problems. The balance of
   global and local search in MA plays a key role in defining the
   performance of MA in problem solving. The probabilistic memetic
   framework (PMF) was thus introduced to model MA as a process involving
   the decision of embracing the separate actions of global or local
   search. PMF balances these two actions by governing the local search
   intensity of each individual based on a theoretical upper bound derived
   while the search progresses. To use PMF for solving combinatorial
   optimization problems, according to our previous study {[}1], we note
   that the appropriate selection of a distance metric for estimating the
   local search intensity is a critical role. Nevertheless, to the best of
   our knowledge, little or no research works in the literature has studied
   on suitable distance metric for PMF in the context of combinatorial
   optimization problems. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by
   presenting a preliminary study on the selection of distance metric in
   PMF for capacitated arc routing problem (CARP). In particular, we first
   analyze the suitability of 4 existing popular distance metrics used in
   combinatorial optimization for solving CARP. Subsequently a score based
   on closeness of neighborhood and fitness landscape correlation is
   proposed to quantify the suitability of a distance metric in estimating
   the local search intensity for PMF in the context of combinatorial
   optimization. Experimental study on 24 egl CARP benchmark instances
   highlighted the significance of choice of appropriate distance metric in
   PMF for solving combinatorial optimization problems, with 4 new best
   known CARP solutions established in the present study.}},

   disruption of traffic, as well as the increase in road users' (vehicle
   operating, time delay and accident) costs. In most areas, the severity
   of winter conditions varies from year to year. Modern society has become
   more vulnerable to these effects. The primary objective of winter
   maintenance is to provide snow and ice-free conditions on the highway
   network. Compared with other road activities, winter maintenance is
   characterized by the need for a fast response, and by the impacts of the
   measures taken being short-lived. That is why scientifically based
   methodology (optimisation of winter maintenance techniques) is needed to
   reduce the above negative consequences. The main aim of the research
   work carried out at KTI Non-Profit Ltd, Budapest was to optimise the
   efficiency and the timing of salt storage and road de-icing policy as a
   function of environmental, economic and traffic safety aspects. The
   selected methodology, Capacitated Arc Routing Problem helps the road
   managing agencies in optimising road winter maintenance fleet routing,
   with reduced air pollution, fuel consumption, in accelerating the
   related activities, besides in reducing road user costs significantly.
   In the research work performed several scenarios on different
   decentralisation levels of salt storage depots were also modelled, and
   investigated from environmental and economic view-points. The scenario
   on heavy de-icing vehicles of standard load capacities with a
   centralized depot was considered as standard variant, while the heavy
   vehicles of variable load capacities and the silos with unlimited
   capacities were also modelled. A Cost Benefit Analysis of the timing of
   salt depot decentralisation proved that the immediate set-up of silos is
   the most economic and efficient variant. The methodology developed can
   also help the local road administrations in devising their winter policy
   documents covering the related objectives, standards, intervention
   levels, priorities for action within the road network, the response
   times, snow clearing and salting routes, salt spreading rates, and
   personnel strategy. (C) 2016The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{In many real-life routing problems, incorporating the negative effects
   of turns is an important, but often overlooked aspect. This is
   especially true for order picking in warehouses, where making the turns
   not only decreases the picking efficiency by reducing the speed of the
   vehicle, but it also results in other unquantifiable effects such as
   vehicle tipovers, increased congestion and increased risk of collision
   with pedestrians or other vehicles. In this paper, we consider the order
   picking problem in a parallel-aisle warehouse by taking into account the
   number and effect of the turns. In particular, we show that the problem
   of minimising the number of turns, minimising travel time under turn
   penalties, the biobjective problem that involves turn and travel time
   minimisation as separate objectives, and the triobjective problem with
   U-turn minimisation as a third objective can all be solved in polynomial
   time. Our computational results show that the algorithms we develop can
   generate the corresponding Pareto front very quickly, and significantly
   outperform heuristic approaches used in practice.}},

Abstract = {{A recurrent task in mathematical programming consists of optimizing
   polytopes with prohibitively many constraints, e.g., the primal polytope
   in cutting-planes methods or the dual polytope in column generation
   (CG). We present a method to optimize such polytopes using the following
   intersection sub-problem: given ray , find the maximum such that is
   feasible. We interpret as a direction of growth from the origin ; is the
   intersection point between and the polytope boundary. To ease the
   exposition, the first part of the paper is devoted to the general
   context of a (primal or dual) polytope with rational data such that: (i)
   the intersection sub-problem can be effectively solved in practice for
   input rays and (ii) is feasible. By iterating over such rays , our
   method produces a sequence of feasible solutions that we prove to be
   finitely convergent. From Section 3 on, we focus on dual polytopes in CG
   formulations. Typically, if the CG (separation) sub-problem can be
   solved by dynamic programming (DP), so can be the intersection
   sub-problem. The proposed integer ray method (IRM) only uses integer
   rays, and so, the intersection sub-problem can be solved using a DP
   scheme based on states indexed by integer ray values. We show that under
   such conditions, the intersection sub-problem can be even easier than
   the CG sub-problem, especially when no other integer data is available
   to index states in DP, i.e., if the CG sub-problem input consists of
   fractional (or large-range) values. As such, the IRM can tackle scaled
   instances (with large-range weights) of capacitated problems that seem
   prohibitively hard for classical CG. This is confirmed by numerical
   experiments on various capacitated Set-Covering problems: Capacitated
   Arc-Routing, Cutting-Stock and other three versions of Elastic
   Cutting-Stock (i.e., a problem class that includes Variable Size Bin
   Packing).}},

Abstract = {{In cutting and packing problems, Dual Feasible Functions (DFFs)
   represent a well established tool for deriving high quality lower bounds
   in very short times. A well-known OFF lower bounding approach consists
   of using DFFs to rapidly generate feasible values for the dual variables
   of a Column Generation (CG) program (i.e., of an extended formulation
   commonly associated to CG). This paper presents a method for extending
   this approach to problems such as Capacitated p-Median, Distance
   Constrained General Routing and related variants (e.g., Capacitated
   Arc-Routing). In contrast to classical OFF bounds for cutting and
   packing, our extended DFF bounds deal with non-equal column costs, i.e.,
   the column costs (primal objective function coefficients) have a more
   complex structure depending on some sums of distances. The general idea
   is to use a (reformulated) classical CG model in which a feasible dual
   solution is expressed as a linear combination of both DFF and non-DFF
   terms. In fact, one of the proposed approaches (the mixed CG-DFF bound
   for Capacitated p-Median in Section 2.2) still requires optimizing a
   restricted CG program, but with fewer variables and easier pricing
   sub-problems. The most refined bound version is the ``DFF warm-started
   CG{''} from Section 2.2.2: it takes dual constraints generated while
   solving the above restricted CG program are re-uses them to warm-start a
   full CG phase. In the best cases, this can yield a speed-up between 2
   and 3 relative to the pure CG. We present numerical experiments on
   Capacitated p-Median, Capacitated Arc-Routing (with fixed costs) and
   Distance Constrained Arc Routing; the comparisons with the CG bound
   concern both the quality and the running time. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) has garnered much attention

   This study describes an efficient memetic algorithm for solving CARP.
   First, the concepts of Rank Number (RankNo), and Rank Count (RankCount)

   essential backbone of the algorithm, the Rank-based Neighborhood Search

   methods relating to selection and evaluation of edge(s) are designed to
   make local search more effective. Two rules, namely mapping rule (MAR)

Abstract = {{Real world applications for vehicle collection or delivery along streets
   usually lead to arc routing problems, with additional and complicating
   constraints. In this paper we focus on arc routing with an additional
   constraint to identify vehicle service routes with a limited number of
   shared nodes, i.e. vehicle service routes with a limited number of
   intersections. This constraint leads to solutions that are better shaped
   for real application purposes. We propose a new problem, the bounded
   overlapping MCARP (BCARP), which is defined as the mixed capacitated arc
   routing problem (MCARP) with an additional constraint imposing an upper
   bound on the number of nodes that are common to different routes. The
   best feasible upper bound is obtained from a modified MCARP in which the
   minimization criteria is given by the overlapping of the routes. We show
   how to compute this bound by solving a simpler problem. To obtain
   feasible solutions for the bigger instances of the KARP heuristics are
   also proposed. Computational results taken from two well known instance
   sets show that, with only a small increase in total time traveled, the
   model BCARP produces solutions that are more attractive to implement in
   practice than those produced by the MCARP model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The mixed capacitated general routing problem (MCGRP) is concerned with
   the determination of the optimal vehicle routes to service a set of
   customers located at nodes and along edges or arcs on a mixed weighted
   graph representing a complete transportation network. Although MCGRP
   generalizes many other routing problems and yields better models for
   several practical problems such as newspaper delivery and urban waste
   collection, this is still an underinvestigated problem. Furthermore,
   most of the studies have focused on the optimization of just one
   objective, that is, cost minimization. Keeping in mind the requirement
   of industries nowadays, MCGRP has been addressed in this paper to
   concurrently optimize two crucial objectives, namely, minimization of
   routing cost and route imbalance. To solve this bi-objective form of
   MCGRP, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), coined as
   Memetic NSGA-II, has been designed. It is a hybrid of non-dominated
   sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), a dominance based local search
   procedure (DBLSP), and a clone management principle (CMP). The DBLSP and
   CMP have been incorporated into the framework of NSGA-II with a view to
   empowering its capability to converge at/or near the true Pareto front
   and boosting diversity among the trade-off solutions, respectively. In
   addition, the algorithm also contains a set of three well-known
   crossover operators (X-set) that are employed to explore different parts
   of the search space. The algorithm was tested on a standard benchmark of
   twenty three standard MCGRP instances of varying complexity. The
   computational experiments verify the effectiveness of Memetic NSGA-II
   and also show the energetic effects of using DBLSP, CMP and X-set
   together while finding the set of potentially Pareto optimal solutions.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a compact method to transform arc routing problem instances
   into node routing problem instances. Any node routing problem instance
   thus created must be solved by a branch-and-price process, such as the
   one described in this paper. The purpose is to make the number of nodes
   in the resulting transformed graphs greater by only one unit than the
   number of required arcs (arcs having demand) in the original graph, that
   is, nodes. This low increase in the number of nodes represents an
   improvement compared to the methods previously presented by Pearn, Assad
   and Golden ( nodes) and by Longo, Poggi de Arago and Uchoa and also by
   Baldacci and Maniezzo ( nodes). Using an adapted version of an existing
   branch-cut-and-price algorithm for a capacitated node routing problem on
   the transformed graph results in an effective approach for a capacitated
   arc routing problem. Computational experiments using this approach
   produced useful lower bounds in reasonable computational time for many
   challenging numerical instances from the literature. Additionally, some
   such previously open instances were solved to optimality for the first
   time.}},

Abstract = {{This article deals with a real-life waste collection routing problem. To
   efficiently plan waste collection, large municipalities may be
   partitioned into convenient sectors and only then can routing problems
   be solved in each sector. Three diverse situations are described,
   resulting in three different new models. In the first situation, there
   is a single point of waste disposal from where the vehicles depart and
   to where they return. The vehicle fleet comprises three types of
   collection vehicles. In the second, the garage does not match any of the
   points of disposal. The vehicle is unique and the points of disposal
   (landfills or transfer stations) may have limitations in terms of the
   number of visits per day. In the third situation, disposal points are
   multiple (they do not coincide with the garage), they are limited in the
   number of visits, and the fleet is composed of two types of vehicles.
   Computational results based not only on instances adapted from the
   literature but also on real cases are presented and analyzed. In
   particular, the results also show the effectiveness of combining
   sectorization and routing to solve waste collection problems. (c) 2015

   introduction of uncertainty into the problem poses severe computational
   challenges addressed by the design of a branch-and-cut algorithm, for

Abstract = {{Collecting and transporting solid waste is a constant problem for
   municipalities and populations in general. Waste management should take
   into account the preservation of the environment and the reduction of
   costs. The goal with this paper is to address a real-life solid waste
   problem. The case reveals some general and specific characteristics
   which are not rare, but are not widely addressed in the literature.
   Furthermore, new methods and models to deal with sectorization and
   routing are introduced, which can be extended to other applications.
   Sectorization and routing are tackled following a two-phase approach. In
   the first phase, a new method is described for sectorization based on
   electromagnetism and Coulomb's Law. The second phase addresses the
   routing problems in each sector. The paper addresses not only
   territorial division, but also the frequency with which waste is
   collected, which is a critical issue in these types of applications.
   Special characteristics related to the number and type of deposition
   points were also a motivation for this work. A new model for a Mixed
   Capacitated Arc Routing Problem with Limited Multi-Landfills is proposed
   and tested in real instances. The computational results achieved confirm

   graph theory that focuses on solving the edge/arc routing for
   optimality. Since many years, operational research devoted to CARP
   counterpart, known as vehicle routing problem (VRP), which does not fit
   to several real cases such like waste collection problem and road
   maintenance. In this paper, we highlighted several extensions of
   capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) that represents the real-life
   problem of vehicle operation in waste collection. By purpose, CARP is
   designed to find a set of routes for vehicles that satisfies all
   pre-setting constraints in such that all vehicles must start and end at
   a depot, service a set of demands on edges (or arcs) exactly once
   without exceeding the capacity, thus the total fleet cost is minimized.
   We also addressed the differentiation between CARP and VRP in waste
   collection. Several issues have been discussed including stochastic
   demands and time window problems in order to show the complexity and
   importance of CARP in the related industry. A mathematical model of CARP
   and its new version is presented by considering several factors such
   like delivery cost, lateness penalty and delivery time.}},

Abstract = {{In many branch-and-price algorithms, the column generation subproblem
   consists of computing feasible constrained paths. In the capacitated
   arc-routing problem (CARP), elementarity constraints concerning the
   edges to be serviced and additional constraints resulting from the
   branch-and-bound process together impose two types of loop-elimination
   constraints. To fulfill the former constraints, it is common practice to
   rely on a relaxation where loops are allowed. In a k-loop elimination
   approach all loops of length k and smaller are forbidden. Following Bode
   and Irnich (2012) for solving the CARP, branching on followers and
   non-followers is the only known approach to guarantee integer solutions
   within branch-and-price. However, it comes at the cost of additional
   task-2-loop elimination constraints. In this paper, we show that a
   combined (k,2)-loop elimination in the shortest-path subproblem can be

Abstract = {{Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) has drawn much attention during
   the last few years. In addition to the goal of minimizing the total cost
   of all the routes, many real-world applications of CARP also need to
   balance these routes. The Multi-objective CARP (MO-CARP) commonly exists
   in practical applications. In order to solve MO-CARP efficiently and
   accurately, this paper presents a Multi-population Cooperative
   Coevolutionary Algorithm (MPCCA) for MO-CARP. Firstly, MPCCA applies the
   divide-and-conquer method to decompose the whole population into
   multiple subpopulations according to their different direction vectors.
   These subpopulations evolve separately in each generation and the
   adjacent subpopulations can share their individuals in the form of
   cooperative subpopulations. Secondly, multiple subpopulations are used
   to search different objective subregions simultaneously, so individuals
   in each subpopulation have a different fitness function, which can be
   modeled as a Single Objective CARP (SO-CARP). The advanced MAENS
   approach for single-objective CARP can be used to search each objective
   subregion. Thirdly, the internal elitism archive is used to construct
   evolutionary pool for each subregion, which greatly speeds up the
   convergence. Lastly, the fast nondominated ranking and crowding distance
   of NSGA-II are used for selecting the offspring and keeping the
   diversity. MPCCA is tested on 91 CARP benchmarks. The experimental
   results show that MPCCA obtains better generalization performance over
   the compared algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Each winter, Canadian municipalities deploy significant capital for snow
   plowing. Any improvements to snowplow operations not only results in
   significant capital savings for municipalities and road agencies, but
   also improves roadway safety and user mobility. In the existing
   research, routing snowplow operations is generally considered a network
   optimization problem; however, the formulations and solutions can be
   very diverse, as each urban area has unique environmental conditions and
   operational constraints. For a specific district and depot, the problem
   is determining a set of routes that ensure that all road links are
   serviced, all operational constraints are satisfied, and total
   operational costs are minimized. This study used a mathematical
   optimization model based on the capacitated arc routing problem (CARP)
   to minimize the total travel distance for snowplow operations in the
   City of Edmonton. Depot location and route number are critical input
   parameters to the operation cost control. Sensitivity analyses were
   conducted to not only derive snowplow routing strategies using the CARP
   methodology, but also draw useful conclusions for winter road
   maintenance planners.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a divide-and-conquer approach is proposed to solve the
   large-scale capacitated arc routing problem (LSCARP) more effectively.
   Instead of considering the problem as a whole, the proposed approach
   adopts the cooperative coevolution (CC) framework to decompose it into
   smaller ones and solve them separately. An effective decomposition
   scheme called the route distance grouping (RDG) is developed to
   decompose the problem. Its merit is twofold. First, it employs the route
   information of the best-so-far solution, so that the quality of the
   decomposition is upper bounded by that of the best-sofar solution. Thus,
   it can keep improving the decomposition by updating the best-so-far
   solution during the search. Second, it defines a distance between
   routes, based on which the potentially better decompositions can be
   identified. Therefore, RDG is able to obtain promising decompositions
   and focus the search on the promising regions of the vast solution
   space. Experimental studies verified the efficacy of RDG on the
   instances with a large number of tasks and tight capacity constraints,
   where it managed to obtain significantly better results than its
   counterpart without decomposition in a much shorter time. Furthermore,
   the best-known solutions of the EGL-G LSCARP instances are much

Abstract = {{Capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) is a well known combinatorial
   problem that requires identifying minimum total distance traveled by a
   fleet of vehicles in order to serve a set of roads without violating the
   vehicles' capacity constraints. A number of optimization algorithms have
   been proposed over the years to solve basic CARPs and their performance
   have been analyzed using selected benchmark suites available in
   literature. From an application point of view, there is a need to assess
   the performance of algorithms on specific class of instances that
   resemble realistic applications, e.g., inspection of electric power
   lines, garbage collection, winter gritting etc. In this paper we
   introduce a benchmark generator that controls the size and complexity of
   the underlying road network resembling a target application. It allows
   generation of road networks with multiple lanes, one-way/two-way roads
   and varying degree of connectedness. Furthermore, an algorithm capable
   of solving real life CARP instances efficiently within a fixed
   computational budget of evaluations is introduced. The proposed
   algorithm, referred to as MA-CARP, is a memetic algorithm embedded with
   a similarity based parent selection scheme inspired by multiple sequence
   alignment, hybrid crossovers and a modified neighborhood search to
   improve its rate of convergence. The mechanism of test instance
   generation is presented for three typical scenarios, namely, inspection
   of electric power lines, garbage collection and winter gritting. The
   code for the generator is available from
   http://seit.unsw.adfa.edu.au/research/sites/mdo/Research-Data/InstanceGe
   nerator.rar. The performance of the algorithm is compared with a
   state-of-the-art algorithm for three generated benchmarks. The results
   obtained using the proposed algorithm are better for all the above
   instances clearly highlighting its potential for solving CARP problems.

   Capacitated Arc Routing Problem}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},

Abstract = {{Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) has attracted the attention of
   many researchers during the last few years, because it has a wide
   application in the real world. Recently, a Decomposition-Based Memetic
   Algorithm for Multi-Objective CARP (D-MAENS) has been demonstrated to be
   a competitive approach. However, the replacement mechanism and the
   assignment mechanism of the offspring in D-MAENS remain to be improved.
   First, the replacement after all the offspring are generated decreases
   the convergence speed of D-MAENS. Second, the representatives of these
   sub-problems are reassigned at each generation by only considering one
   objective function. In response to these issues, this paper presents an
   improved D-MAENS for Multi-Objective CARP (ID-MAENS). The two
   improvements of the proposed algorithm are as follows: (1) the
   replacement of the solutions is immediately done once an offspring is
   generated, which references to the steady-state evolutionary algorithm.
   The new offspring will accelerate the convergence speed; (2) elitism is
   implemented by using an archive to maintain the current best solution in
   its decomposition direction during the search, and these elite solutions
   can provide helpful information for solving their neighbor sub-problems
   by cooperation. Compared with the Multi-Objective CARP algorithm,
   experimental results on large-scale benchmark instances egl show that
   the proposed algorithm has performed significantly better than D-MAENS
   on 23 out of the total 24 instances. Moreover, ID-MAENS find all the
   best nondominated solutions on 13 egl instances. In the last section of
   this paper, the ID-MAENS also proves to be competitive to some
   state-of-art single-objective CARP algorithms in terms of quality of
   solutions and computational efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Multirobot sensor-based coverage path planning determines a tour for
   each robot in a team such that every point in a given workspace is
   covered by at least one robot using its sensors. In sensor-based
   coverage of narrow spaces, i.e., obstacles lie within the sensor range,
   a generalized Voronoi diagram (GVD)-based graph can be used to model the
   environment. A complete sensor-based coverage path plan for the robot
   team can be obtained by using the capacitated arc routing problem
   solution methods on the GVD-based graph. Unlike capacitated arc routing
   problem, sensor-based coverage problem requires to consider two types of
   edge demands. Therefore, modified Ulusoy algorithm is used to obtain
   mobile robot tours by taking into account two different energy
   consumption cases during sensor-based coverage. However, due to the
   partially unknown nature of the environment, the robots may encounter
   obstacles on their tours. This requires a replanning process that
   considers the remaining energy capacities and the current positions of
   the robots. In this paper, the modified Ulusoy algorithm is extended to
   incorporate this dynamic planning problem. A dynamic path-planning
   approach is proposed for multirobot sensor-based coverage of narrow
   environments by considering the energy capacities of the mobile robots.
   The approach is tested in a laboratory environment using Pioneer 3-DX
   mobile robots. Simulations are also conducted for a larger test

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design, development and initial evaluation of a
   decision support system (DSS) for capacitated arc routing. The research
   was motivated from a collaboration project with The City of Calgary
   business unit for Waste \&Recycling Services (WRS). Their services cover
   residential waste collection for 306,000 residential homes. Intelligent
   decision support was needed to address the increasing business
   complexity and the need for higher efficiency and transparency of
   decision-making processes.
   The proposed routing is incorporating seasonal trends of waste creation.
   The seasonal changes are between 10.000 (low) to 25000 (peak) tons per
   month for the whole city. Different arc routings apply for different
   amounts of waste. A prototype DSS was developed with several components
   including one for prediction of waste amounts and one for arc routing of
   trucks. The paper describes the methodology, the existing DSS-WRS
   prototype implementation and preliminary results from its case study
   implementation.}},

Abstract = {{The Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) is a well-known NP-hard
   combinatorial optimization problem where, given an undirected graph, the
   objective is to find a minimum cost set of tours servicing a subset of
   required edges under vehicle capacity constraints. There are numerous
   applications for the CARP, such as street sweeping, garbage collection,
   mail delivery, school bus routing, and meter reading. A Greedy
   Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) with Path-Relinking (PR) is
   proposed and compared with other successful CARP metaheuristics. Some
   features of this GRASP with PR are (i) reactive parameter tuning, where
   the parameter value is stochastically selected biased in favor of those
   values which historically produced the best solutions in average; (ii) a
   statistical filter, which discard initial solutions if they are unlikely
   to improve the incumbent best solution; (iii) infeasible local search,
   where high-quality solutions, though infeasible, are used to explore the
   feasible/ infeasible boundaries of the solution space; (iv) evolutionary
   PR, a recent trend where the pool of elite solutions is progressively
   improved by successive relinking of pairs of elite solutions.
   Computational tests were conducted using a set of 81 instances, and
   results reveal that the GRASP is very competitive, achieving the best
   overall deviation from lower bounds and the highest number of best
   solutions found. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) stands among the hardest
   combinatorial problems to solve or to find high quality solutions. This
   becomes even more true when dealing with large instances. This paper
   investigates methods to improve on lower and upper bounds of instances
   on graphs with over 200 vertices and 300 edges, dimensions that, today,
   can be considered of large scale. On the lower bound side, we propose to
   explore the speed of a dual ascent heuristic to generate capacity cuts.
   These cuts are next improved with a new exact separation enchained to
   the linear program resolution that follows the dual heuristic. On the
   upper bound, we implement a modified Iterated Local Search procedure to
   Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) instances obtained by
   applying a transformation from the CARP original instances.
   Computational experiments were carried out on the set of large instances
   generated by Brandao and Eglese and also on the regular size sets. The
   experiments on the latter allow for evaluating the quality of the
   proposed solution approaches, while those on the former present improved
   lower and upper bounds for all instances of the corresponding set. (C)

Abstract = {{The Node, Edge, and Arc Routing Problem (NEARP) was defined by Prins and
   Bouchenoua in 2004, although similar problems have been studied before.
   This problem, also called the Mixed Capacitated General Routing Problem
   (MCGRP), generalizes the classical Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem
   (CVRP), the Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP), and the General
   Routing Problem. It captures important aspects of real-life routing
   problems that were not adequately modeled in previous Vehicle Routing
   Problem (VRP) variants. The authors also proposed a memetic algorithm
   procedure and defined a set of test instances called the CBMix
   benchmark. The NEARP definition and investigation contribute to the
   development of rich VRPs. In this paper we present the first lower bound
   procedure for the NEARP. It is a further development of lower bounds for
   the CARP. We also define two novel sets of test instances to complement
   the CBMix benchmark. The first is based on well-known CARP instances;
   the second consists of real life cases of newspaper delivery routing. We
   provide numerical results in the form of lower and best known upper
   bounds for all instances of all three benchmarks. For three of the
   instances, the gap between the upper and lower bound is closed. The
   average gap is 25.1\%. As the lower bound procedure is based on a high
   quality lower bound procedure for the CARP, and there has been limited
   work on approximate solution methods for the NEARP, we suspect that a
   main reason for the rather large gaps is the quality of the upper bound.
   This fact, and the high industrial relevance of the NEARP, should
   motivate more research on approximate and exact methods for this
   important problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Multi-objective Undirected Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (MUCARP)
   is the optimization problem aimed at finding the best strategy for
   servicing a subset of clients localized along the links of a logistic
   network, by using a fleet of vehicles and optimizing more than one
   objective. In general, the first goal consists in minimizing the total
   transportation cost, and in this case the problem brings back to the
   well-known Undirected Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (UCARP). The
   motivation behind the study of the MUCARP lies in the study of real
   situations where companies working in the logistic distribution field
   deal with complex operational strategies, in which different actors
   (trucks, drivers, customers) have to be allocated within an unified
   framework by taking into account opposite needs and different employment
   contracts. All the previous considerations lead to the MUCARP as a
   benchmark optimization problem for modeling practical situations. In
   this paper, the MUCARP is heuristically tackled. In particular, three
   competitive objectives are minimized at the same time: the total
   transportation cost, the longest route cost (makespan) and the number of
   vehicles (i.e., the total number of routes). An approximation of the
   optimal Pareto front is determined through an optimization-based
   heuristic procedure. whose performances are tested and analyzed on
   classical benchmark instances. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) is the determination of vehicle
   tours that serve all positive-demand edges (required edge) exactly once
   without exceeding vehicle capacity while minimizing sum of all tour
   costs. In CARP, total demand of a tour is calculated by means of all
   required edges on the tour. In this study, a new CARP variation is
   introduced, which considers not only required edges but also traversed
   edges while calculating total demand of the tour. The traversing demand
   occurs when the traversed edge is either servicing or non-servicing
   (deadheading). Since the new CARP formulation incurs deadheading edge
   demands it is called CARP with deadheading demands. An integer linear
   model is given for the problem which is used to solve small-sized
   instances, optimally. A constructive heuristic is presented to solve the
   problem which is a modified version of a well-known CARP heuristic.
   Furthermore, two post-optimization procedures are presented to improve
   the solution of the heuristic algorithm. The effectiveness of the
   proposed methods is shown on test problems, which are obtained by
   modifying CARP test instances. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents the first full-fledged branch-and-price (bap)
   algorithm for the capacitated arc-routing problem (CARP). Prior exact
   solution techniques either rely on cutting planes or the transformation
   of the CARP into a node-routing problem. The drawbacks are either models
   with inherent symmetry, dense underlying networks, or a formulation
   where edge flows in a potential solution do not allow the reconstruction
   of unique CARP tours. The proposed algorithm circumvents all these
   drawbacks by taking the beneficial ingredients from existing CARP
   methods and combining them in a new way. The first step is the solution
   of the one-index formulation of the CARP in order to produce strong cuts
   and an excellent lower bound. It is known that this bound is typically
   stronger than relaxations of a pure set-partitioning CARP model. Such a
   set-partitioning master program results from a Dantzig-Wolfe
   decomposition. In the second phase, the master program is initialized
   with the strong cuts, CARP tours are iteratively generated by a pricing
   procedure, and branching is required to produce integer solutions. This
   is a cut-first bap-second algorithm and its main function is, in fact,
   the splitting of edge flows into unique CARP tours.}},

   models the structured knowledge of the strategy behind solving problems

   heuristics specified as trees of mathematical functions which are

   used to compute a heuristic value for each edge with unsatisfied

   available to the heuristic. The virtual vehicle then serves the edge

   is repeated until all requirements have been satisfied. The resulting

Pages = {{173-189}},
Abstract = {{The Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) is a combinatorial
   optimization problem similar to the well-known Capacitated Vehicle
   Routing Problem (CVRP). In the CARP, the customers' demands are located
   on the edges (arcs) of a general (not necessarily complete) graph. This
   is in contrast to the CVRP, where demand is located on the nodes of a
   complete graph. While the CVRP has been extensively studied over the
   past couple of decades, the number of articles and research results on
   the CARP is significantly lower. To partially fill this gap in the
   literature, a new heuristic and two new algorithms for the CARP are
   proposed and evaluated. Our Savings-based Heuristic for the ARP (SHARP)
   is inspired on the popular Clarke and Wright savings heuristic for the
   CVRP. The SHARP procedure outperforms the classical Path Scanning
   heuristic (PSH) and thus it can be integrated into most meta-heuristics
   to provide a `good' and fast initial solution to medium-to-large size
   ARPs which cannot be solved using exact approaches. Using both SHARP and
   PSH as a base, two randomized algorithms are developed in this paper.
   These are multi-start algorithms which introduce a biased randomization
   process to each heuristic. This randomization process uses biased
   probability distributions, such as the geometric one, in order to induce
   some degree of randomness in the solution-construction stage while
   keeping most of the heuristic `common sense'. In order to state their
   efficiency, both randomized algorithms are compared and evaluated using
   a standard set of benchmarks. The results show that our randomized
   version of SHARP, RandSHARP, is quite competitive and far superior to
   the PSH-based randomized algorithm.}},

   PCARP is an extension of the well-known Capacitated Arc Routing Problem
   (CARP) from a single period to a multi-period horizon. PCARP is a
   hierarchical optimization problem which has a primary objective
   (minimizing the number of vehicles mnv) and a secondary objective
   (minimizing the total cost tc). An important factor that makes PCARP
   challenging is that its primary objective mnv is little affected by
   existing operators and thus difficult to improve. We propose a new
   Memetic Algorithm (MA) for solving PCARP. The MA adopts a new solution
   representation scheme and a novel crossover operator. Most importantly,
   a Route-Merging (RM) procedure is devised and embedded in the algorithm
   to tackle the insensitive objective mnv. The MA with RM (MARM) has been
   compared with existing meta-heuristic approaches on two PCARP benchmark
   sets and a real-world data set. The experimental results show that MARM
   obtained better solutions than the compared algorithms in much less

Abstract = {{The Open Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (OCARP) is a NP-hard
   combinatorial optimization problem where, given an undirected graph, the
   objective is to find a minimum cost set of tours that services a subset

   is related to the Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) but differs
   from it since OCARP does not consider a depot, and tours are not
   constrained to form cycles. Applications to OCARP from literature are
   discussed. A new integer linear programming formulation is given,
   followed by some properties of the problem. A reactive path-scanning
   heuristic, guided by a cost-demand edge-selection and ellipse rules, is
   proposed and compared with other successful CARP path-scanning
   heuristics from literature. Computational tests were conducted using a
   set of 411 instances, divided into three classes according to the
   tightness of the number of vehicles available; results reveal the first
   lower and upper bounds, allowing to prove optimality for 133 instances.

Abstract = {{In this paper we deal with the mixed capacitated general routing problem
   with turn penalties. This problem generalizes many important arc and
   node routing problems, and it takes into account turn penalties and
   forbidden turns, which are crucial in many real-life applications, such
   as mail delivery, waste collection and street maintenance operations.
   Through a polynomial transformation of the considered problem into a
   Generalized Vehicle routing problem, we suggest a new approach for
   solving this new problem by transforming it into an Asymmetric
   Capacitated Vehicle routing problem. In this way, we can solve the new
   problem both optimally and heuristically using existing algorithms. A
   powerful memetic algorithm and a set of 336 new benchmark instances are
   also suggested. The experimental results show that the average deviation
   of the suggested solution method is less than 0.05\% with respect to
   optimum. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) is representative of numerous

   extended version of this problem that entails both total service time
   and fixed investment costs. We subsequently propose a hybrid ant colony
   optimization (ACO) algorithm (HACOA) to solve instances of the extended
   CARP. This approach is characterized by the exploitation of heuristic
   information, adaptive parameters, and local optimization techniques: Two
   kinds of heuristic information, arc cluster information and arc priority
   information, are obtained continuously from the solutions sampled to
   guide the subsequent optimization process. The adaptive parameters ease
   the burden of choosing initial values and facilitate improved and more
   robust results. Finally, local optimization, based on the two-opt
   heuristic, is employed to improve the overall performance of the
   proposed algorithm. The resulting HACOA is tested on four sets of
   benchmark problems containing a total of 87 instances with up to 140

Abstract = {{The capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) is a challenging
   combinatorial optimization problem with many real-world applications, e.
   g., salting route optimization and fleet management. There have been
   many attempts at solving CARP using heuristic and meta-heuristic

   attempts formulate CARP as a single-objective problem although it
   usually has more than one objective, especially considering its

   (MO-CARP). A new memetic algorithm (MA) called decomposition-based MA
   with extended neighborhood search (D-MAENS) is proposed. The new
   algorithm combines the advanced features from both the MAENS approach
   for single-objective CARP and multiobjective evolutionary optimization.
   Our experimental studies have shown that such combination outperforms
   significantly an off-the-shelf multiobjective evolutionary algorithm,
   namely nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II, and the
   state-of-the-art multiobjective algorithm for MO-CARP (LMOGA). Our work

Abstract = {{Creating digital maps often requires driving around the streets in a
   so-called ``mapping van{''}. Tele Atlas, the world leading supplier of
   maps and map data, uses a fleet of such vehicles to take pictures of
   streets and road signs. Minimising the number of days that a vehicle
   needs to traverse all streets in a given region gives rise to a
   capacitated arc routing problem. A specific characteristic of this
   problem, however, is the fact that taking pictures in the direction of
   the sun should be avoided as much as possible. This requirement adds
   soft time windows to the problem.
   In this paper we solve the mobile mapping van problem by transforming it
   into a vehicle routing problem with soft time windows. We then apply a
   hybrid metaheuristic, consisting of a local search phase to decrease the
   number of days and an iterated local search phase to minimise the time
   window violations. An exact linear programming solver is embedded to
   calculate the ideal starting time of the vehicle in each street. Our
   method is tested on academic and real-life problem instances and shown
   to be effective. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) is a challenging vehicle
   routing problem with numerous real world applications. In this paper, an
   extended version of CARP, the multidepot capacitated arc routing problem
   (MCARP), is presented to tackle practical requirements. Existing CARP
   heuristics are extended to cope with MCARP and are integrated into a
   novel evolutionary framework: the initial population is constructed
   either by random generation, the extended random path-scanning
   heuristic, or the extended random Ulusoy's heuristic. Subsequently,
   multiple distinct operators are employed to perform selection,
   crossover, and mutation. Finally, the partial replacement procedure is
   implemented to maintain population diversity. The proposed evolutionary
   approach (EA) is primarily characterized by the exploitation of
   attributes found in near-optimal MCARP solutions that are obtained
   throughout the execution of the algorithm. Two techniques are employed
   toward this end: the performance information of an operator is applied
   to select from a range of operators for selection, crossover, and
   mutation. Furthermore, the arc assignment priority information is
   employed to determine promising positions along the genome for
   operations of crossover and mutation. The EA is evaluated on 107

Abstract = {{Multi-robot sensor-based coverage path planning requires every point

   sensor-based coverage of narrow environments by considering energy
   capacities of the robots. For this purpose, the environment was modeled
   by a Generalized Voronoi diagram-based graph to guarantee complete
   sensor-based coverage. Then, depending on the required arc set, a
   complete coverage route was created by using the Chinese Postman Problem
   or the Rural Postman Problem, and this route was partitioned among
   robots by considering energy capacities. Route partitioning was realized
   by modifying the Ulusoy partitioning algorithm which has polynomial
   complexity. This modification handles two different energy consumptions
   of mobile robots during sensor-based coverage, which was not considered
   before. The developed algorithm was coded in C + + and implemented on
   P3-DX mobile robots both in laboratory and in MobileSim simulation
   environments. It was shown that the convenient routes for energy
   constrained multi-robots could be generated by using the proposed

Abstract = {{When addressing the problem of snow removal for secondary roads, a tool
   for solving the rural postman problem can be very useful. We present
   some ideas for heuristics for this problem. The heuristics are of the
   same type as the classical Frederickson heuristic. The ideas concern the
   order of the main steps in such a method, namely constructing a
   connected graph with all vertices having even degree, containing all the
   required edges. We also propose two postprocessing heuristics for
   improving the tours and removing unnecessary detours. The computational
   tests show that the ideas are interesting alternatives to the classical
   approach, and that running times are acceptable. We study problem
   characteristics that may indicate which method to choose. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Capacitated arc routing problems (CARP) arise in distribution or
   collecting problems where activities are performed by vehicles, with
   limited capacity, and are continuously distributed along some

   considers directed as well as undirected required links in the

   aggregated version of the original model. Although this model is no

Abstract = {{Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) has drawn much attention during
   the last few years because of its applications in the real world.
   Recently, we developed a Memetic Algorithm with Extended Neighborhood
   Search (MAENS), which is powerful in solving CARP. The excellent
   performance of MAENS is mainly due to one of its local search operators,
   namely the Merge-Split (MS) operator. However, the higher computational
   complexity of the MS operator compared to traditional local search
   operators remains as the major drawback of MAENS, especially when
   applying it to large-size instances. In this paper, we propose a
   heuristic candidate list strategy to sample the neighbors generated by
   the MS operator instead of enumerating or sampling them randomly, in
   order to avoid unnecessary callings of the MS operator during local
   search. Based on the strategy, an improved algorithm of MAENS, namely
   MAENS-II, is developed. Experimental results on benchmark instances
   showed that MAENS-II managed to obtain the same level of solution
   quality as MAENS with much less computational time. This should be
   credited to the utilization of the proposed heuristic strategy. On the
   other hand, in case both MAENS and MAENS-II were provided comparable
   computational time, MAENS-II outperformed MAENS in terms of solution
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{The Undirected Capacitated Arc Routing Problem is a classical arc
   routing problem arising in practical situations (road maintenance,
   garbage collection, mail delivery, school bus routing, etc.) with the
   aim of minimizing the total transportation cost of a set of routes that
   service a set of required edges under capacity constraints. Most of
   logistic companies are interested in minimizing not only the total
   transportation cost, they also are focused in managing the deliveries on
   the edges, in such a way that the duration of the longest trip does not
   exceed an upper time limit, to take into account the working day
   duration of the drivers. Moreover, all the demands of the required edges
   are satisfied by considering a limited number of vehicles at the depot.
   In this paper, the Multi-objective Undirected Capacitated Arc Routing
   Problem where different and competitive objectives are taken into
   account simultaneously, is defined and studied. Three objectives are
   considered in order to: minimize the total transportation cost, the
   longest route (makespan) and the number of vehicle used to service all
   the required edges (i.e., the total number of routes). To find a set of
   solutions belonging to the optimal pareto front, an optimization-based
   heuristic procedure is proposed and its performance is evaluated on a

Abstract = {{The capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) has attracted much attention

   MAENS is distinct from existing approaches in the utilization of a novel

   capable of searching using large step sizes, and thus has the potential
   to search the solution space more efficiently and is less likely to be
   trapped in local optima. Experimental results show that MAENS is
   superior to a number of state-of-the-art algorithms, and the advanced
   performance of MAENS is mainly due to the MS operator. The application
   of the MS operator is not limited to MAENS. It can be easily generalized

Abstract = {{The capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) is an important and practical
   problem in the OR literature. in short, the problem is to identify
   routes to service (e.g.. pickup or deliver) demand located along the
   edges of a network such that the total cost of the routes is minimized.
   In general, a single route cannot satisfy the entire demand due to
   capacity constraints on the vehicles. CARP belongs to the set of NP-hard
   problems; consequently numerous heuristic and metaheuristic solution
   approaches have been developed to solve it. In this paper an ``ellipse
   rule{''} based heuristic is proposed for the CARP. This approach is
   based on the path-scanning heuristic. one of the mostly used greedy-add
   heuristics for this problem. The innovation consists basically of
   selecting edges only inside ellipses when the vehicle is near the end of
   each route. This new approach was implemented and tested on three
   standard datasets and the solutions are compared against: (i) the
   original path-scanning heuristic; (ii) two other path-scanning
   heuristics and (iii) the three best known metaheuristics. The results
   indicate that the ``ellipse rule{''} approach lead to improvements over
   the three path-scanning heuristics, reducing the average distance to the
   lower bound in the test problems by about 44\%. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this work we present an algorithm for solving the Prize-collecting
   Rural Postman Problem. This problem was recently defined and is a
   generalization of other arc routing problems like, for instance, the
   Rural Postman Problem. The main difference is that there are no required
   edges. Instead, there is a profit function on the edges that must be
   taken into account only the first time that an edge is traversed.
   The problem is modeled as a linear integer program where the system has
   an exponential number of inequalities. We propose a solution algorithm
   where iteratively we solve relaxed models with a small number of
   inequalities, that provide upper bounds, and we propose exact separation
   procedures for generating violated cuts when possible. We also propose a
   simple heuristic to generate feasible solutions that provide lower
   bounds at each iteration. We use a two-phase method with different
   solvers at each phase. Despite the difficulty of the problem, the
   numerical results from a series of computational experiments with
   various types of instances assess the good behavior of the algorithm. In
   particular, 75\% of the instances were optimally solved with the LP
   relaxation of the model. The remaining instances were optimally solved

Abstract = {{The capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) is a well-known and
   fundamental vehicle routing problem. A promising exact solution approach
   to the CARP is to model it as a set covering problem and solve it via
   branch-cut-and-price. The bottleneck in this approach is the pricing
   (column generation) routine. In this paper, we note that most CARP
   instances arising in practical applications are defined on sparse

Abstract = {{Capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) has attracted much attention
   during the last few-years due to its wide applications in real life.
   Since CARP is NP-hard and exact methods are only applicable for small
   instances, heuristics and metaheuristic methods are widely adopted when
   solving CARP. This paper demonstrates one major disadvantage encountered
   by traditional search algorithms and proposes a novel operator named
   global repair operator (GRO) to address it. We further embed GRO in a
   recently proposed tabu search algorithm (TSA) and apply the resultant
   repair-based tabu search (RTS) algorithm to five well-known benchmark
   test sets. Empirical results suggest that RTS not only outperforms TSA
   in terms of quality of solutions but also converges to the solutions
   faster. Moreover, RTS is also competitive with a number of
   state-of-the-art approaches for CARP. The efficacy of GRO is thereby
   justified. More importantly, since GRO is not specifically designed for
   the referred TSA, it might be a potential tool for improving any
   existing method that adopts the same solution representation.}},

Abstract = {{Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) has attracted much interest
   because of its wide applications in the real world. Recently, a memetic
   algorithm proposed by Lacomme et al. (LMA) has been demonstrated to be a
   competitive approach to CARP. The crossover operation of LMA is carried
   out based on an implicit representation scheme, while it conducts local
   search on the basis of an explicit representation scheme. Hence, the
   search process of LMA involves frequent switch between the spaces
   defined by the two representation schemes. However, a good solution in
   one space is not necessarily good in the other. In this paper, we show
   that the local search process of LMA might be ineffective due to such
   reason, and suggest adopting a more careful way to coordinate the local
   search. As a result, two new local search methods are proposed, which
   resulted in two improved LMA (ILMA) algorithms. Experimental results on
   benchmark instances of CARP showed that the ILMA significantly
   outperformed LMA in terms of solution quality, and sometimes even in
   terms of computational time. Furthermore, ILMA improved the best known
   solutions for 8 problem instances out of the total 24 instances.}},

   On the other hand, partially unknown nature is handled with proposed

   initial complete coverage route is constructed considering robot energy
   capacities using classical capacitated arc routing problem (CARP)
   approach with some minor modifications related to coverage problem. But,

Abstract = {{The Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) arises in applications like
   waste collection or winter gritting. Exact algorithms are still limited
   to small problems and metaheuristics are required for large scale
   instances. The paper presents an improved genetic algorithm (GA) for
   solving an extended version of the CARP (ECARP) like prohibited turns or
   slop problem. This new algorithm improves the population structure and
   chromosome organization mode of the traditional genetic algorithm (TGA),
   and devises several simple and high-effective evolutionary operators,
   avoiding the premature convergence phenomenon in the TGA. According to
   our experiment analysis, the improved GA proposed in our paper can solve
   the ECARP effectively, meanwhile, the comparison experiment between the
   improved GA and classical MA (memetic algorithms) for the basic CARP
   shows that our new algorithm is more effective and can get the better
   results than NU when solving the large-scale basic CARP.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are powerful search techniques that are used to
   solve difficult problems in many disciplines. Unfortunately, they can be
   very demanding in terms of computation load and memory. Parallel Genetic
   Algorithms (PGAs) are parallel implementations of GAs which can provide
   considerable gains in terms of performance and scalability. PGAs can
   easily be implemented on networks of heterogeneous computers or on
   parallel mainframes.
   In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent model conceived as a
   conceptual and practical framework for distributed genetic algorithms
   used both to reduce execution time and to get closer to optimal
   solutions. Instead of using expensive parallel computing facilities, our
   distributed model is implemented on easily available networked PCs. In
   order to show that the parallel coevolution of different sub-populations
   may lead to an efficient search strategy, we design an efficient
   information exchange strategy based on different dynamic migration
   window methods and a selective migration model. To evaluate the proposed
   approach, different kinds of experiments have been conducted on an
   extended set of Capacitated Arc Routing Problem(CARP). Obtained results

   a local search, and an optional path relinking process. Computational

   with the best published algorithms: on a set of 24 instances, the best
   combination of components finds 17 optima (including 4 new ones) and
   improves 5 best-known solutions. Moreover, when applied to the CARP
   without time windows, these GRASPs are as effective as state-of-the-art

   generalizes many important arc routing problems (ARPs) and has some

   WGRP polyhedron, for which some general properties and some large
   families of facet-inducing inequalities are presented. Moreover, since
   the WGRP contains many well-known routing problems as special cases,
   this paper also provides a global view of their associated polyhedra.

Abstract = {{The capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) is a very hard vehicle
   routing problem for which the objective-in its classical form-is the
   minimization of the total cost of the routes. In addition, one can seek
   to minimize also the cost of the longest trip.
   In this paper, a multi-objective genetic algorithm is presented for this
   more realistic CARP. Inspired by the second version of the Non-dominated
   sorted genetic algorithm framework, the procedure is improved by using
   good constructive heuristics to seed the initial population and by
   including a local search procedure. The new framework and its different
   flavour is appraised on three sets of classical CARP instances
   comprising 81 files.
   Yet designed for a bi-objective problem, the best versions are
   competitive with state-of-the-art metaheuristics for the single
   objective CARP, both in terms of solution quality and computational
   efficiency: indeed, they retrieve a majority of proven optima and
   improve two best-known solutions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A well-known transformation by Pearn, Assad and Golden reduces a
   capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) into an equivalent capacitated
   vehicle routing problem (CVRP). However, that transformation is regarded
   as unpractical, since an original instance with r required edges is
   turned into a CVRP over a complete graph with 3r + 1 vertices. We
   propose a similar transformation that reduces this graph to 2r + 1
   vertices, with the additional restriction that a previously known set of
   r pairwise disconnected edges must belong to every solution. Using a
   recent branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm for the CVRP, we observed that
   it yields an effective way of attacking the CARP, being significantly
   better than the exact methods created specifically for that problem.
   Computational experiments obtained improved lower bounds for almost all
   open instances from the literature. Several such instances could be
   solved to optimality.
   Scope and purpose The scope of this paper is transforming arc routing
   problems into node routing problems. The paper shows that this approach
   can be effective and, in particular, that the original instances may
   generate node routing instances that behave as if the size is not
   increased. This result is obtained by slightly modifying the well-known
   transformation by Pearn, Assad and Golden from capacitated arc routing
   problem (CARP) to the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), that
   is regarded as unpractical. The paper provides a computational
   experience using a recent branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm for the

Abstract = {{This paper considers an important class of sensor networks where the
   ultimate goal is not necessarily to collect each individual measurement
   but rather a potentially smaller set of statistics. Considering link
   capacity constrained topologies, we derive results that optimally
   allocate rate/distortion to information collected by the sensors. As a
   key contribution, we determine how the flow of information emanating
   from the sensors should be managed, yielding optimal routing algorithms
   and jointly optimized networks. Our analysis encompasses the typical
   scenarios that are widely observed in sensor networks, and over these
   scenarios, we quantify the gains offered by sending the statistics
   rather than the measurement data itself. Our results reveal bottleneck
   situations over various scenarios, where directly performing bandwidth
   allocation over the statistics does not provide the desired gains.
   We start the analysis from a simple scenario, where a fixed node
   aggregates all the information in the sensor network and relays the
   information to a remote control center. We obtain close form expressions
   and illustrate how allocating bandwidth for each individual measurement
   (Case-1) performs compared to allocating it for each desired statistic
   (Case-2) in different bottleneck situations. Then, we extend this
   scenario to the case where we optimally select a number of aggregators
   from a cloud of sensor nodes. In this second scenario, under well
   defined bandwidth constraints, we look at the optimum clustering
   problem, in which the goal is to select the best aggregation nodes to
   minimize the total distortion of the desired statistics at the remote
   control node. We provide an algorithmic solution that returns the
   optimum aggregation points and the optimum size of each cluster under
   some mild assumptions. We finally turn our attention to the general
   routing problem and provide an algorithm that performs routing and
   bandwidth allocation jointly. We also study the performance and behavior
   of bandwidth allocation for both Case-1 and Case-2.}},

Abstract = {{The Periodic Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (PCARP) generalizes the
   well known NP-hard Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) by extending
   the single period to multi-period horizon. The Capacitated Arc Routing
   Problem (CARP) is defined on an undirected network in which a fleet of
   identical vehicles is based at a depot node. A subset of edges, the
   tasks, must be serviced by a vehicle. The CARP consists of determining a
   set of feasible vehicle trips that minimizes the total cost of traversed
   edges. The PCARP involves the assignment of tasks to periods and the
   determination of vehicles trips of in each period, to minimize the total
   cost on the whole horizon. This new problem is encountered in various
   real life applications such as waste collection, mail delivery, etc. In
   this paper, a new linear programming model and the first lower bounds
   based on a graph transformation are proposed. A metaheuristic approach -
   Scatter Search (SS) - for the PCARP is developed and evaluated on a

Abstract = {{In this paper we address the problem of district design for the
   organisation of arc-routing activities. In particular, the focus is on
   operations like winter gritting and road maintenance. The problem
   involves how to allocate the road network edges to a set of depots with
   given locations. The collection of edges assigned to a facility forms a
   district in which routes have to be designed that start and end at the
   facility. Apart from the ability to support good arc routing,
   well-designed districts for road-maintenance operations should have the
   road network to be serviced connected and should define clear
   geographical boundaries. We present three districting heuristics and
   evaluate the quality of the partitions by solving capacitated arc
   routing problems in the districts, and by comparing the solution values
   with a multi-depot CARP cutting plane lower bound. Our experiments
   reveal that based on global information about the distribution system
   (ie the number of facilities or districts, the average edge demand and
   the vehicle capacity) and by using simple guidelines, an adequate
   districting policy may be selected.}},

Abstract = {{In Arc Routing Problems, ARPs, the aim is to find on a graph a minimum

   we deal with the Mixed General Routing Problem which consists of finding
   a minimum cost traversal of a given link subset and a given vertex
   subset of a mixed graph. A formulation is given that uses only one
   variable for each link (edge or arc) of the graph. Some properties of
   the associated polyhedron and some large families of facet-inducing

Abstract = {{With the advent of VLSI technology, circuits with more than one million
   transistors have been integrated onto a single chip. As the complexity
   of ICs grows, the time and money spent on designing the circuits become
   more important. A large, often dominant, part of the cost and time
   required to design an IC is consumed in the routing operation. The
   routing of carriers, such as in IC chips and printed circuit boards, is
   a classical problem in Computer Aided Design. With the complexity
   inherent in VLSI circuits, high performance routers are necessary. In
   this paper, a crucial step in the channel routing technique, the single
   row routing (SRR) problem, is considered. First, we discuss the
   relevance of SRR in the context of the general routing problem.
   Secondly, we show that heuristic algorithms are far from solving the
   general problem. Next, we introduce evolutionary computation, and, in
   particular, genetic algorithms (GAs) as a justifiable method in solving
   the SRR problem. Finally, an efficient O(nk) complexity technique based
   on GAs heuristic is obtained to solve the general SRR problem containing
   n nodes. Experimental results show that the algorithm is faster and can
   often generate better results than many of the leading heuristics
   proposed in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we address the problem of optimal routing in shortest-path
   data networks-such as Internet protocol (IP) networks-using open
   shortest path first (OSPF) routing information protocol (RIP) and other
   interior gateway protocols (IGPs). We propose a combinatorial algorithm
   for solving the optimal shortest-path routing problem, which consists of
   finding the link-distance metric assignment to all links in a network
   that results in optimal shortest-path routing and minimizes the average
   delay of packets in the network. Minimizing the delay of packets is
   critical, especially in the emerging voice over IP (VolP) networks,
   quality of service (QoS)centric virtual private networks (VPNs) and
   networks carrying other delay-sensitive traffic flows. Finding optimal
   link metrics that result in shortest-path routing is a special case of a
   classical inverse shortest-path problem. We propose a combinatorial
   approximation algorithm and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   algorithm by comparing the results with bounds for several data network
   instances. We investigate not only the sensitivity of the solution with
   respect to the starting point, but also the sensitivity of the
   algorithm's performance with respect to uncertainty in traffic. We show
   that one preferred starting point consistently converges to near optimal
   solutions. In addition, we extract two other distance metrics from the
   solution to the optimal general routing problem and show that these are
   preferred starling points for small or sparsely connected networks.}},

Abstract = {{In the capacitated are routing problem with multiple centers (M-CARP)
   the objective is to find routes starting from the given depots or
   centers such that each required are is served, capacity (and usually
   additional) constraints are satisfied and total travel cost is
   minimized. In this paper we consider a heuristic transformation of the
   M-CARP into a multiple center capacitated minimum spanning tree problem
   with are constraints, that we call are-constrained CMST. An algorithm
   for determining initial feasible solutions as well as an improvement
   procedure for this problem are described and the ``re-translation{''} of
   CMST solutions into the CARP context is explained. It is shown that the
   objective function value of the obtained CARP solution is easily derived
   from the respective value of the corresponding heuristic CMST solution.
   Furthermore, the possibility of including side constraints and the
   consideration of additional objective functions is discussed.

   tabu search and simulated annealing metastrategies embedded in the
